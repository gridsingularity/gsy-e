## How to contribute to D3A

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/gridsingularity/d3a/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/gridsingularity/d3a/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.


#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the Pull Request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.


#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the D3A will generally not be accepted.


#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in an email to d3a@gridsingularity.com

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.


#### **Do you have questions about the source code or the functionality of D3A?**

* Consult our Wiki [D3A Wiki page](https://gridsingularity.atlassian.net/wiki/x/d4D5Mg)

* If things are still unclear: Ask any question about how to use D3A in the [D3A mailing list](https://groups.io/g/d3a).
