Setup file for displaying the finite power plant strategy.
The finite power plant strategy requires an energy rate value, which will be used for the lifetime
of this strategy. The second parameter is the maximum available power that this power plant
can produce. In this setup file a constant power production of 0.1 kW is assumed, and it is
configured so low in order to validate that the strategy works as expected.
