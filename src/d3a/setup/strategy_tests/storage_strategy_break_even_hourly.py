To validate the break even hourly profile the backend plot Energy Trade Profile Of House 1
is required. The energy rates for the storages are displayed in this plot, and these rates
should adhere to the break even hourly profiles that are defined in this module.
Tip: It's interesting to see the change in results from changing the initial_pv_rate_option
between 1(historical average prices) and 2(market maker price).
