"""
This setup file shows the scenario of PV decreasing its unsold offer based on RISK/percentage.
In this scenario, the risk: 20, initial_rate_option: 2 i.e. based on market_maker_rate.
Load wants to purchase energy for 24hr @ max_energy_rate: 7.01 i,e, load will only buy PV's
energy if its lower than its max_energy_rate.

Considering tick_length = 15s, and max_offer_traversal_length = 10 (in order to propagate
offer from one end to the other extreme end). So, the minimum waiting time for offer update
would be offer_update_wait_time = tick_length * max_offer_traversal_length (15 * 10 = 150s)
Considering, time_slot =  15m -> 900s
The max_possible_offer_update_per_slot = time_slot / offer_update_wait_time (900/150=6).
However, due to some reason, max_possible_offer_update_per_slot is made one unit less.
Once Spyros is back, it has to be discussed.

PV's initial sell offer would be based on market_maker_rate. To consider
max_offer_traversal_length, PV's unsold offer would be updated 5 time per market slot such
that the its final offer would be (35*0.2=7).

Since, the PV can only decrease its unsold offer only 6 times per market slot. And based on risk
its unsold offer final rate should be 7. So, after every update its unsold offer would be decrease
by (35 - 7) / 5 = 5.6


When the the PV offer rate goes as low as 7; only then load will purchase PV's energy.

At hr:13, mmr is deliberately configured to 40. After, updates of unsold offers at this hour.
Its final price would be 40*0.2=8 i.e. greater than Load's acceptable rate. It has been checked in
integration test to confirm these PV offers are not bought at these instances. Same for hr:14
