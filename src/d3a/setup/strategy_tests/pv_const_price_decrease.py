This setup file test the PV energy_rate_decrease_per_update i.e. 1 cents/kWh/update
In this case, initial PV offer would be based on market maker rate i.e. 35 cents/kWh

You can expect 5 to 6 updates per market slot (with 15 sec ticks). See below:

Considering tick_length = 15s, and max_offer_traversal_length = 10 (in order to propagate
offer from one end to the other extreme end). So, the minimum waiting time for offer update
would be offer_update_wait_time = tick_length * max_offer_traversal_length (15 * 10 = 150s)
Considering, time_slot =  15m -> 900s
The max_possible_offer_update_per_slot = time_slot / offer_update_wait_time (900/150=6).
However, due to some reason, max_possible_offer_update_per_slot is made one unit less.
Once Spyros is back, it has to be discussed.
