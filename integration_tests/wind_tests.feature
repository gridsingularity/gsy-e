Feature: WindStrategy Tests

  Scenario: WindUserProfileStrategy follows the profile provided by the user as csv
     Given we have a scenario named strategy_tests/user_profile_wind_csv
     And gsy_e is installed
     When we run the simulation with setup file strategy_tests.user_profile_wind_csv and parameters [24, 60, 60]
     Then the UserProfileWind follows the Wind profile of csv
