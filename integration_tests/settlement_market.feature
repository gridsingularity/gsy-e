    Given we have a scenario named default_2a

    Then no settlement market is created

  Scenario: Trades are performed correctly on settlement markets
    Given we have a scenario named settlement_market/simple
    And gsy_e is installed
    When we run the simulation with setup file settlement_market.simple and parameters [24, 60, 60]
    Then settlement markets are created
    And settlement market trades have been executed

  Scenario: D3ASIM-3653: Trade events are correctly triggered in the settlement load
    Given we have a scenario named settlement_market/simple_load_cell_tower
    And gsy_e is installed
