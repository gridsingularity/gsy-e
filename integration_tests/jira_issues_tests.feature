Feature: Jira Issues Tests

   Scenario: D3ASIM-595, average trade rate should be constant for every market slot
     Given we have a scenario named jira/default_595
     And d3a is installed
     When we run the d3a simulation with jira.default_595 [24, 15, 15]
     Then average trade rate is constant for every market slot for all markets
     And there are no trades with the same seller and buyer name

  Scenario: D3ASIM-645, storage should buy energy from commercial producer
    Given we have a scenario named jira/default_645
    And d3a is installed
    When we run the d3a simulation with jira.default_645 [24, 15, 15]
    Then storage buys energy from the commercial producer
    And storage final SOC is 100%
    And storage buys energy respecting the break even buy threshold

  Scenario: D3ASIM-662, IAA should always track offers back to its source
     Given we have a scenario named strategy_tests/home_cp_ess_load
     And d3a is installed
     When we run the d3a simulation with strategy_tests.home_cp_ess_load [24, 15, 15]
     Then on every market slot there should be matching trades on grid and house markets
     And there should be no unmatched loads

  Scenario: D3ASIM-706, multi-day simulation for load and pv
     Given we have a scenario named default_3
     And d3a is installed
     When we run a multi-day d3a simulation with default_3 [None, 72, 15, 60]
     Then pv produces the same energy on each corresponding time slot regardless of the day
     And all loads consume the same energy on each corresponding time slot regardless of the day
     And all loads adhere to the hours of day configuration

  Scenario: D3ASIM-780, Electrolyser does not report 0 soc on first market slot
     Given we have a scenario named jira/d3asim_780
     And d3a is installed
     When we run the d3a simulation with jira.d3asim_780 [24, 60, 60]
     Then there should be a reported SOC of 0.1 on the first market

  Scenario: D3ASIM-778, load reaches maximum price before the end of the market slot
     Given we have a scenario named jira/d3asim_778
     And d3a is installed
     When we run the simulation with setup file jira.d3asim_778 and parameters [24, 15, 15, 0, 1]
     Then there should be trades on all markets using the max load rate


  Scenario: D3ASIM-871, unmatched loads are not reported if hours per day are covered
     Given we have a scenario named jira/d3asim_871
     And d3a is installed
     When we run the simulation with setup file jira.d3asim_871 and parameters [24, 15, 15, 0, 1]
     Then there should be no unmatched loads

  Scenario: D3ASIM-874, alternative pricing can buy energy from IAA if there is not enough self-consumption
     Given we have a scenario named jira/d3asim_869
     And d3a is installed
     When we run the d3a simulation with jira.d3asim_869 [24, 60, 60]
     Then there should be no unmatched loads
     And the Load of House 1 should only buy energy from IAA between 5:00 and 8:00
     And the Commercial Producer should never sell energy

  Scenario: D3ASIM-891, bids are reported correctly in csv export files
     Given we have a scenario named two_sided_pay_as_clear.default_2a
     And d3a is installed
     When we run the d3a simulation on console with two_sided_pay_as_clear.default_2a
     Then there are nonempty files with offers (without balancing offers) and bids for every area

  TODO: D3ASIM-1001 To be removed once the bug has been solved

  Scenario: D3ASIM-962, Device Statistics are calculated and returned correctly
    Given we have a scenario named jira/d3asim_962
    And d3a is installed
    When we run a multi-day d3a simulation with jira.d3asim_962 [2019-01-01, 48, 60, 60]
    Then the device statistics are correct
