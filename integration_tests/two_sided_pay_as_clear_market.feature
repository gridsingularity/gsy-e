Feature: Two sided pay_as_clear market tests

  Scenario: All Offers & Bids are traded based on Market Clearing Rate
     Given we have a scenario named two_sided_pay_as_clear/default_2a
     And d3a is installed
     When we run the simulation with setup file two_sided_pay_as_clear.default_2a and parameters [24, 15, 15, 0, 1]
     Then all trades are equal to market_clearing_rate
