    Given we have a scenario named <scenario>
    And d3a is installed
    When we run the simulation with setup file <scenario> and parameters [24, 60, 60, 1]
    Then the traded energy report the correct accumulated traded energy
    And the energy bills report the correct accumulated traded energy price
    And the energy bills report the correct external traded energy and price

  Scenario Outline: Test Cumulative Bills
    Given we have a scenario named <scenario>
    And d3a is installed
    When we run the simulation with setup file <scenario> and parameters [24, 60, 60, 1]
    Then the cumulative energy bills for each area are the sum of its children

     When a simulation is created for scenario <scenario>
     And the method <method> is registered
     And the configured simulation is running
     And a message is sent on <channel>

     When the redis_connection is enabled
     And the simulation is able to transmit intermediate results
     And the simulation is able to transmit final results

  Scenario: Run integration tests with settings file
     Given we have a scenario named default_2a
     And d3a is installed

     And the past markets are not kept in memory
     And we run the simulation with setup file <scenario> and parameters [24, 60, 60, 1]
     Then the unmatched loads are identical no matter if the past markets are kept
