Feature: Run integration tests

  Scenario Outline: Run integration tests on console
     Given we have a scenario named <scenario>
     And d3a is installed
     When we run the d3a simulation on console with <scenario>
     Then we test the export functionality of <scenario>
  Examples: Scenarios
     | scenario |
     | integration_test_setup |

  Scenario: Test offers, bids and balancing offers are exported
     Given we have a scenario named two_sided_market/with_balancing_market
     And d3a is installed
     When we run the d3a simulation on console with two_sided_market.with_balancing_market
     Then there are files with offers and bids for every area

  Scenario Outline: Run general integration tests for simulation
     Given we have a scenario named <scenario>
     And d3a is installed
     When we run the d3a simulation with <scenario> [<duration>, <slot_length>, <tick_length>]
     Then we test the output of the simulation of <scenario> [<duration>, <slot_length>, <tick_length>]
  Examples: Settings
     | scenario               | duration | slot_length | tick_length |
     | integration_test_setup |    2     |      20     |      1      |
     | integration_test_setup |    4     |      10     |      5      |
     |         default_2      |    24    |      60     |      60     |
     |        default_2a      |    24    |      60     |      60     |
     |        default_2b      |    24    |      60     |      60     |
     |        default_3       |    24    |      60     |      60     |
     |        default_3a      |    24    |      60     |      60     |
     |        default_3b      |    24    |      60     |      60     |
     |    default_3_pv_only   |    24    |      60     |      60     |
     |        default_4       |    24    |      60     |      60     |
     |        default_5       |    24    |      60     |      60     |
     |        default_csv     |    24    |      60     |      60     |

  Scenario Outline: Simulation subscribes on the appropriate channels
     Given d3a is installed
     When a simulation is created for scenario <scenario>
     And the method <method> is registered
     And the configured simulation is running
     And a message is sent on <channel>
     Then <method> is called
  Examples: Incoming events
     | scenario   | channel    | method       |
     | default_2a | 1234/stop  | stop         |
     | default_2a | 1234/pause | toggle_pause |
     | default_2a | 1234/reset | reset        |

  Scenario: Simulation publishes intermediate and final results
     Given d3a is installed
     When a simulation is created for scenario default_2a
     And the simulation is able to transmit intermediate results
     And the simulation is able to transmit final results
     And the configured simulation is running
     Then intermediate results are transmitted on every slot
     And final results are transmitted once

  Scenario: Run integration tests with settings file
     Given we have a scenario named default_2a
     And d3a is installed
     When we run simulation on console with default settings file
     Then we test the export functionality of default_2a

  Scenario: Simulation returns same results for different market counts
    Given we have a scenario named default_2a
    And d3a is installed
    When we run the simulation with setup file default_2a with two different market_counts
    Then the results are the same for each simulation run
