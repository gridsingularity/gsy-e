Feature: GridFee integration tests

  Scenario Outline: Grid fees are calculated based on the original offer rate
     Given we have a scenario named grid_fees/non_compounded_grid_fees
     And gsy_e is installed
     And gsy_e uses an one-sided market
     And the minimum offer age is <min_offer_age>
     When we run the simulation with setup file grid_fees.non_compounded_grid_fees and parameters [24, <slot_length>, <tick_length>]
     Then trades on the House 1 market clear with 12.0 cents/kWh and at grid_fee_rate with 0.0 cents/kWh
     Then trades on the Neighborhood 1 market clear with 12 cents/kWh and at grid_fee_rate with 0.5 cents/kWh
     Then trades on the Grid market clear with 11.5 cents/kWh and at grid_fee_rate with 1.0 cents/kWh
     Then trades on the Neighborhood 2 market clear with 10.5 cents/kWh and at grid_fee_rate with 0.5 cents/kWh
     Then trades on the House 2 market clear with 10.0 cents/kWh and at grid_fee_rate with 0.0 cents/kWh
