1. To start using the [Grid Singularity Energy Exchange](https://www.d3a.io/){target=_blank}), you need to register your account by selecting a user email and password. You will then receive an email with a link to confirm your account.
2. You can design your own project by clicking on “new project” and then create a new simulation.
3. The first step in setting up a simulation is to define the simulation general and market settings, described in more detail below.
4. The next step is to design your grid. Once you arrive in the grid setup, the first thing that you will have to do is to define the market maker. Subsequently, you can start building the **digital twin** of your grid including submarkets and relevant energy assets that can all be individually configured. The setup is intended to represent the **physical architecture** of the real energy market (country, region, neighbourhood, house, etc.).
5. After your grid setup is complete, you can run your simulation. When it is finished you can view multiple scrollable plots and tables on the Results page.

For a step-by-step explanation on how to set up your simulation, please watch our [tutorial](https://youtu.be/85PwYRjXKnU){target=_blank}. You can also contact us at [contact@gridsingularity.com](mailto:contact@gridsingularity.com) or on slack [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/gsycommunity/shared_invite/zt-cksg629e-ClRPNV7TkW_cTOxDdlaz1Q)

Note: For smoother simulations and smaller queues, we have set some boundaries. First, the simulations are limited in their duration. You can currently set the duration from **1 to 7 days**. Furthermore, the number of agents per simulation is limited. Each market and asset is represented by an agent and you can define up to **1000 agents**.
