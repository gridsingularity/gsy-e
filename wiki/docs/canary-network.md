The Grid Singularity Canary Test Network (CN) is the first peer-to-peer energy exchange with **live energy asset** data and **real-time trading**. At the current stage, CN acts as a uni-directional bridge between the **physical** and **digital** world, reading real consumption and generation data from real energy assets in real-time, while simulating trading with the grid’s digital twins. Flexible assets’ digital twins such as storage are **unbundled** from their physical ones, to simulate the benefits of Local Energy Markets without real world energy and financial transactions.

All energy trades in the GSy Canary Test Network are simulated, meaning that no real-world financial or energy transaction occurs and flexible assets such as batteries may physically charge or discharge at different times than their simulated behaviour in the Canary Network.

The GSy Canary Test Network runs at real time, meaning that assets send their actual energy usage through the Asset API once every **15 minutes**. This mimics how deployed exchanges will operate, but provides only a few sets of data points every hour, requiring iterations of experiments to which doesn’t meet the needs of the ongoing research efforts to determine effective market, grid fee, and agent designs. Determining the mechanics for deployable markets require frequent iterations and experimentation. Grid Singularity simulations allow for energy exchanges to be run at warp speed, meaning one week of trading can be simulated and analysed in less than two hours. This functionality allows for **rapid prototyping** of grid models and **experimental setups**.

CN is designed to host an iterative process to test new ideas in a safe environment, closest as possible to reality.
