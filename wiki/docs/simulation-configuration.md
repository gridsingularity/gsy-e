To start building a simulation, the user is guided through the simulation configuration pages. These pages allow a user to model their use-case and D3A market structure that the energy devices in their model will use to trade energy.

The simulation configuration consists of two steps:

- [General Settings](general-settings.md), where general simulation parameters can be set.
- [Grid setup](grid-setup.md), where the user can build the grid configuration for their use-case.
