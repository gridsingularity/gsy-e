A finite power plant is an energy supplier that offers a configurable amount of power per time slot at a set rate. This energy asset is currently available to users running simulations based on our [backend source code](assets-installation.md), while users of the Grid Singularity interface Singularity Map can apply [Grid market settings](grid-market-settings.md) to integrate a power plant as an external supplier of the simulated local energy market.
