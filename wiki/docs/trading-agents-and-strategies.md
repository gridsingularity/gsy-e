Grid Singularity’s exchange engine has a built-in template trading agent. The agent’s trading strategy is **deterministic**. Each consumer asset will first try to buy energy at a **low** price and, if not cleared, the price will increase **linearly** during the [market slot](markets.md#market-slots) until a user-defined maximum is reached. In turn, assets generating energy will try to sell at a **high** price first and, if not cleared, reduce their rate linearly until a user-set minimum is reached.

**Offers’** trading settings are as follows:

* initial_selling_rate
* final_selling_rate
* update_interval
* energy_rate_decrease_per_update
* fit_to_limit

The following plot shows the changing energy rate in a [spot market slot](spot-market-types.md)  (slot_length = 15min) for four different trading settings.

If `fit_to_limit` is set to `True`, `energy_rate_decrease_per_update` is ignored and a rate decrease per time is calculated, starting at `initial_selling_rate` and ending at `final_selling_rate` while updating the rate at each `update_interval`.

**Bids’** Trading settings:

* initial_buying_rate
* final_buying_rate
* update_interval
* energy_rate_increase_per_update
* fit_to_limit

The following plot shows the energy rate change in a spot market slot (slot_length = 15min) for different trading settings. If `fit_to_limit` is set to `True`, `energy_rate_increase_per_update` is ignored and a rate increase per time is calculated that starts at `initial_buying_rate` and ends at `final_buying_rate` while updating the rate at each `update_interval`.

Assets can also deploy more intelligent trading strategies, as shown in the example [Heat Pump Trading Strategy](heat-pump.md#heat-pump-asset-trading-strategy) and further demonstrated in the 2020 Energy Singularity Challenge, described in the following two articles:

* Grid Singularity. (September 10, 2020). _[En Route to Energy Singularity Odyssey Momentum: Learnings from the 2020 Chaos Experiment](https://gridsingularity.medium.com/en-route-to-energy-singularity-odyssey-momentum-learnings-from-the-2020-chaos-experiment-8dc38ff26869 ){target=_blank}_
