[Grid Singularity Exchange](https://map.gridsingularity.com/singularity-map) provides the software tools, enabling prosumers and consumers organized in energy communities (also known as energy cooperatives, community choice aggregations or microgrids in different regions of the world), with the support of local aggregators, to simulate and implement peer-to-peer and community energy trading through the creation of active local energy markets (LEMs). Importantly, our [open source](licensing.md) and modular platform optimises the use of local resources and enables individuals with equitable access to energy trading, at par with large energy suppliers.

The first step towards deploying a local energy market is to configure and optimise its structure using Grid Singularity’s free, web-based simulation ([user interface](https://map.gridsingularity.com/singularity-map)). The user can build a “digital twin” representation of physical energy systems and energy markets (using template or real-world data) and run simulations in order to [assess the financial and social benefits of local trading and the impact of different actions or assets in the system](https://gridsingularity.medium.com/modelling-study-to-assess-the-potential-benefits-of-trading-in-and-between-local-energy-d721395ddd4b). This wiki provides a detailed guide for prosumers and energy communities to set up a [simulation](community.md), as well as additional guidelines for [aggregators](connect-ctn.md) and [grid operators](implement-grid-fees-walkthrough.md).  Please note that our [backend code](https://github.com/gridsingularity/gsy-e) is open source under GPLv3 and offers the full functionality of the active version of the Grid Singularity Exchange, while the web-based [user interface](https://map.gridsingularity.com/singularity-map) offers eased access to the majority of features found in the backend.

Grid Singularity facilitates an individual or energy asset centered, bottom-up, hierarchical market design by connecting aggregators and grid operators, through an application interface ([Asset API](asset-api-template-script.md) and [Grid Operator API](grid-operator-api-template-script.md), respectively). More specifically, aggregators connect distributed energy assets of a community (including households, businesses and other energy users), while grid operators account for grid costs and access local flexibility for advanced grid management. Connected energy assets are digitally represented by [trading agents](default-trading-strategy.md) pursuing trading strategies based on user preferences, such as consuming only renewable energy or trading with a preferred partner, achieving diverse degrees of freedom. Assets are typically grouped inside homes based on the owner and trade in a community market. Multiple communities can be connected inside higher markets depending on the geographical reach of the peer-to-peer system and voltage architecture of the grid.

Grid Singularity’s technical approach includes a blockchain implementation which will incorporate the energy asset identity authentication from [Energy Web Switchboard](https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-switchboard/), and ensure transparency and settlement automation, by operating a [parachain](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-parachains) on a Polkadot based network. Notably, these networks just like the Energy Web Chain do not rely on a proof-of-work mechanism of validation and therefore [do not overuse electricity](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/energy-web-foundation-fix-blockchain-biggest-problem). Our path to decentralisation and the implementation of Symbiotic Energy Markets is described in [the following discussion paper](https://medium.com/@gridsingularity/discussion-paper-grid-singularitys-implementation-of-symbiotic-energy-markets-bd3954af43c8).

When the Grid Singularity Exchange is deployed as a distributed local energy exchange, the traditional role of the grid operator, which manages the connection to the power grid, and the utility, as a provider of energy, would still continue to be required to integrate the local energy market with the wider grid network. This ensures the reliability of supply in case of a deficit within a community but also export possibilities in case of a surplus. The primary difference is that a utility would no longer be the only market actor with which a household exchanges energy, but one of multiple.

Grid Singularity fosters interoperability and open-source development, collaborating with other market actors that provide grid management and asset aggregation services and supporting complementary services such as data and smart trading algorithm that further enhance the efficiency of local energy markets (LEM), optimising the use of local renewable resources and other individual and community benefits.

Grid Singularity’s Exchange is a highly innovative and effective grid modernization solution.

1. First, it empowers customer engagement and provides utmost **[degrees of freedom](degrees-of-freedom.md)** in energy markets enhancing individual and community choices (e.g., type of energy consumed or preferred trading partner), lowering barriers and creating incentives for all participants.
2. Second, it creates a **resilient market** by ensuring equal access, transparent pricing, and trading at optimal market levels (i.e., between assets and buildings or facility and grid).
3. Third, it **incentivizes and facilitates** the integration of clean distributed energy resources (DERs) onto the grid closer to load centers.
4. Fourth, grid operators can use it to **implement flexible grid tariffs** to benefit from the local market flexibility to alleviate congestion.
5. Fifth, the [Grid Singularity API](grid-operator-api-template-script.md) provides instantaneous granular data to the grid operator–which historically has relied upon changes in detected load and alterations from the forecast–enabling the operator to improve management, flexibility, and grid performance.
6. Sixth, peer-to-peer trading is **market-driven**, not based upon predetermined pricing, which optimizes local consumption and thus the use of (cheaper) local renewables, increasing affordability, reducing reliance and overall/peak load on the grid, supporting efficient asset utilization, and reducing system losses.
7. Seventh, it **increases community self-sufficiency and energy savings**, providing emergency power backup, and mitigating the need for new transmission infrastructure.
8. Finally, the peer-to-peer trading system **incentivizes private investment** in electric system infrastructure by increasing revenue from renewable DERs and providing decision-making tools.
