Markets contain submarkets and energy assets. Energy assets can post bids and offers in their market. Markets are interconnected by [inter-area agents](market-agent.md) in a hierarchical network, which pass bids and offers between markets until they are matched, following a select [market clearing mechanism](spot-market-types.md).

##User Interface configuration

The following market parameters can be set:

*   **Name**: Must be unique
*   **Grid fee**: If set to _yes_ and with a _non-None_ value, a fee will be applied to each trade that passes through or is cleared in this market. The [grid fee](grid-fees.md) is either [constant](constant-fees.md), expressed in cents/kWh, or [variable](percentage-fees.md), expressed as a share of total price in percentage terms (%) depending on the parameters set in the [simulation general settings](general-settings.md).
*   **Transformers capacity**: Import and export limits of the transformer in kVA. In the current implementation these limits are purely visual indicators and do not limit actual import/export of the market.
*   **Baseline import/export**: Allows the user to compare the current simulation imports/exports to a baseline, set in kWh. These values are used in the calculation of the [Peak Percentage KPI](peak-percentage.md).

The simulation configuration interface is shown below:

##Backend configuration

These parameters can be set in the backend in the Area / Market class :

```python
Area('Market',
                         [
... "some assets here"
                         ],
grid_fee_constant=2,
throughput=ThroughputParameters(import_capacity_kVA=2.0, export_capacity_kVA=2.0, baseline_peak_energy_import_kWh=0.4, baseline_peak_energy_export_kWh=0.4))
```
