The PV strategy determines the price of the PV offers on the spot market. It also determines what to do when its offer is not immediately accepted by a buyer. Initial parameters that can be defined include:

- `panel_count`: The number of panels in the simulation
- `max_panel_power_W`: Peak power rating per panel
- `update_interval`: time after which the rate should be updated (type: pendulum duration object). Range[1:(slot_length_minute-1)]
- `final_selling_rate`: The minimum offer rate (ct/kWh)
- `initial_selling_rate`: The maximum offer rate (ct/kWh)
- `use_market_maker_rate`: If this flag is set `True`, then agent's `initial_selling_rate` would be overwritten with [Market Maker Strategy](market-maker-strategy.md)'s defined `energy_rate`
- `energy_rate_decrease_per_update`: It is configured as the cents/kWh decrease per update.
- `fit_to_limit`: derive bidding behaviour from a linear fitted curve of a buying rate between `initial_selling_rate` and `final_selling_rate` (boolean value) within the bidding interval. If activated, `energy_rate_decrease_per_update = (initial_selling_rate - final_selling_rate) / max(int((slot_length / update_interval) -1), 1)`.



For information buying rate decrease behaviour, please see: [Energy Rate Settings and Behaviour](how-strategies-adjust-prices.md).



The PV profile can be configured as a saved profile here (via choosing the *PVPredefinedStrategy*):

- `cloud_coverage`: (0: sunny; 1: partially cloudy; 2: cloudy). Using this parameter, the simulation allows the user to choose between three solar curves that are stored in the simulation for convenience. No default value for this parameter.

How to add a PV device to the setup-file:

```
Area('H2 PV', strategy=PVStrategy(panel_count=4, initial_selling_rate=30,
                                  final_selling_rate=5, fit_to_limit=True,
                                  update_interval=duration(minutes=5)))
```

In order to understand how the strategy is actually decreasing its `offered_rate` in the case of not getting traded, see the following diagram.

####  Relation of different parameters for energy pricing

Lets assume the user has configured its *PVStrategy* with these parameters `(initial_selling_rate=30, final_selling_rate=0, fit_to_limit=True, update_interval=5mins)` and `slot_length=15min` At the start of market, PV would place its initial offer at the rate of `initial_selling_rate`. If `fit_to_limit` is set to `True`, it will reduce its `offer_rate` linearly such that its `final_offer` before the end of `market_slot` should be equal to `final_selling_rate`. Number of available updates in such a case is `(slot_length / update_interval) -1) → (15/5 -1)=2`. Therefore, it is possible for a user to update its offer two times inside the same `market_slot`. The first update would happen at 5mins. The calculated `energy_rate_decrease_per_update → (30 - 0) / 2 → 15`. So, the PV will reduce it `selling_rate` at 5th min from 30 to 15 cts/kWh and at 10th min from 15 to 0 cts/kWh.
