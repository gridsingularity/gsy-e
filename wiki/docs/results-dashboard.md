title: Results Dashboard (Key Performance Indicators)
---

The Results Dashboard illustrates the results of a simulated energy community. It updates while the simulation is running and it is stored for up to 90 days or until the user decides to delete or to rerun the simulation.

The following results (key performance indicators) are currently available for the local energy market simulations:

- **[Bills (energy cost) and traded energy volume](bills-traded-energy.md)**

- **[Self-sufficiency and Self-consumption](self-sufficiency-self-consumption.md)**

- **[Trade profile(s)](trade-profile.md)**

- **[Aggregate market summary](aggregate-market-summary.md)**

- **[Price graphs](price.md)**

- **[Cumulative trades charts and bids and offers graph](trades.md)**

The user is able to view results for each market or asset in the grid configuration. The results load automatically for the community as a whole, but home-specific results can also be viewed by clicking on a select home. The home and asset results can also be retrieved by clicking on the list icon in the bottom right corner and then on the community asset icon that will appear, generating a list of all the homes and assets in that community (see picture below).

The user can also download the results of the simulation for a deeper analysis of the community trading patterns by clicking on the download results icon under the settings tab, as shown in the picture below. For more information about this option, see [Results Download](results-download.md)
