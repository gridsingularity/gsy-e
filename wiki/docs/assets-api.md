# Asset API documentation
The D3A API client allows you to create agents that follow custom trading strategies to buy and sell energy in the energy market. The agent can request and receive information through the API, feed that information into an algorithm, and post bids or offers on a live simulated exchange. This document covers installation and descriptions of the functions available.

### Using the API Client with a Running Simulation

#### Start Redis server

To use the API locally, your script connects to the simulation using a local Redis instance. To start the redis instance, open a new terminal and run the following command :

```
redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf
```

#### Launch simulation
This requires you to have the d3a simulation installed on your machine. If you have yet to do this, see the installation instructions. First navigate to the `d3a` folder in a new terminal, then activate the d3a environment with:

```
workon d3a
```

Then run:
```
d3a -l INFO run -t 15s -s 15m --setup odyssey_momentum.odyssey_training --start-date 2014-10-01 --enable-external-connection
```

After a few seconds, trading should begin, and should look something like the below.

### Launch smart agents
Open a new terminal to run your trading strategy script (python file). In this python file you can code the trading strategy for the assets you manage. A template python script is provided. You are also able to print some information that you will get with your API calls.

You can run your script in the terminal. First navigate to the folder `d3a/src/d3a/setup/odyssey_momentum/`

Then run
```
python assets_api_template.py
```

### Grid Setup File Configuration

Backend simulations require modifications to the setup files to allow API connections. When you connect to the web application, the grid operator will make the necessary changes instead. This section is only relevant if you’re modifying your own setup files.

#### Open Device for external connection
In the setup file, a device must be designated as open to external connection via the API. This is controlled when setting up the simulation in the setup file by designating the ExternalStrategy for each relevant device:
```python
Area( 'house-1-s',
              [
                     Area('h1-load-s', strategy=LoadProfileExternalStrategy(daily_load_profile=load1,
                                                                             initial_buying_rate=Houses_initial_buying_rate,
                                                                             use_market_maker_rate=True)
                     ),

                     Area('h1-pv-s', strategy=PVUserProfileExternalStrategy(power_profile=pv1,
                                                                             initial_selling_rate=PV_initial,
                                                                             final_selling_rate=PV_final)
                     ),

                     Area('h1-storage-s', strategy=StorageExternalStrategy(initial_soc=50)
                     ),

               ], grid_fee_percentage=0, transfer_fee_const=0, external_connection_available=True
           ),
```
By default, template strategies do not allow connections. Please also ensure that the appropriate libraries are imported (as in the template setup file provided).

#### Open Area for external connection
The API supports multiple areas exposing their market statistics (e.g. min, max, avg, median price and volume of energy) to external devices. Access is controlled when setting up the simulation, using the Area class boolean argument called external_connection_available:
```python
Area(
         'Member 2',
         [ ... ], # Children of the area
         external_connection_available=True
),
```
If set to true, the area allows all of its ‘child’ devices to request its market statistics. By default, this external_connection_available is set to False.


### API Commands
There are multiple instances that can get you information or enable you to take action in the simulation.

#### Event-Triggered Functions
In order to facilitate offer and bid management and scheduling, a python file with the class `Oracle` is provided. The `Oracle` class acts as an information aggregator for all of the energy assets (e.g. loads and PVs) you manage, and allows you to post bids and offers on their behalf. A few functions are triggered on different types of events, and can be overridden, useful to take actions when market events occur.

##### Each New Market Slot (on_market_cycle(self, market_info))
When a new market slot is available the client will get notified via an event. It is possible to capture this event and perform operations after it by overriding the on_market_cycle method.

Ex: `def on_market_cycle(self, market_info):`

In the variable market_info you will get a dictionary with information on the market and your devices. You receive information for each device you manage. The return values are the following :
```python
{
  "name": "house2",
  "id": "13023c7d-205d-4b3a-a434-02375eb277ca",
  "start_time": # start-time of the market slot,
  "duration_min": # 15,
  "device_info": {
    "energy_requirement_kWh": # energy that the device has to buy during this market slot,
    "available_energy_kWh": # energy that the device has to sell during this market slot
  },
  "event": "market",
  "device_bill": {
    "bought": # energy bought in kWh,
    "sold": # energy sold in kWh,
    "spent": # money spent in €,
    "earned": # money earned in €,
    "total_energy": # bought - sold,
    "total_cost": # spent - earned,
    "market_fee": # € that goes in grid fee,
    "type": # type of the strategy
    },
  "last_market_stats": {
    "min_trade_rate": # minimum trade price in €/kWh,
    "max_trade_rate": # maximum trade price in €/kWh,
    "avg_trade_rate": # average trade price in €/kWh,
    "total_traded_energy_kWh": # total energy traded in kWh
    }
}
```

##### On % of Market Slot Completion (on_tick(self, tick_info))

Each 10% of market slot completion (e.g. 10%, 20%, 30%, …), the same information as market_info will be passed, updated with new device energy requirements. This can be used to update your bid or offer price at these milestones.

##### On Trade (on_trade(self, trade_info))

Each time the device you manage makes a trade, information about the trade is passed through trade_info. This information can be stored locally or acted upon.

##### On Simulation Finish (on_finished(self))

This executes when the simulation finishes, and can be used to trigger exporting data, training a model or exiting the code.

### Device Commands
#### Register - Backend
Devices are automatically registered to your aggregator in the provided template script. You must update the list below in the oracle template script to the devices you want to manage. Each oracle registered must have a unique name.

```python
# Designate devices and markets to manage
oracle_name = 'oracle'
load_names = ['Load 1', 'Load 2']
pv_names = ['PV 1']
storage_names = ['Storage 1']
```

#### Register - Frontend
To register for a collaboration (public simulation hosted by a grid operator) on d3a.io, limited changes must be made in the agent script, including updating the simulation id (found in the url of the collaboration's results page)

#### Sending bids and offers
The oracle is able to post bids and offers for multiple devices at the same time. This is implemented already in the template agent for you, so you can focus instead on your strategy.

A `batch_command` dictionary structure is used. To update an existing bid with a load and update both your bid and offer with a storage device, you would use:

```
batch_commands = {}
batch_commands[device_event["area_uuid"]] = [
        {"type": "update_bid",
         "price": price,
         "energy": energy},]
batch_commands[device_event["area_uuid"]] = [
        {"type": "update_bid",
         "price": buy_price,
         "energy": buy_energy},
        {"type": "update_offer",
         "price": sell_price,
         "energy": sell_energy},)
self.batch_command(batch_commands)
```

Note: The total amount of energy bid at any point is limited to the energy requirement of the device. Updating a bid during a market slot deletes other active bids.
Additionally, the price of your bids/offers should be a positive float otherwise it will get rejected by the market.

#### Trading Strategies

A simple trading strategy is available in the template agent. See the `TODO` flags there to see how you may update your trading strategy based on predictions about the market and energy requirements.
