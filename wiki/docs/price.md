The price graph shows the min, max, and average price of energy in â‚¬/kWh for each 15 minute market slot in this market. The grid fee is also shown if applied. If no trade occurred during a certain market interval, no lines are plotted. If grid fees are set in that market as a constant value, a fourth line is plotted to reflect its price.
