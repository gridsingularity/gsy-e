The MarketAgent (MA) plays a crucial role in the communication architecture of Grid Singularityâ€™s exchange, allowing different markets in the hierarchy to interact and trade with each other. The MarketAgent is created for each market (households/buildings, streets, etc. that do not have preset trading strategies) and mainly deals with forwarding bids and offers markets of different hierarchy levels.

The following illustration shows a sample grid setup and the role of the MarketAgent in the market hierarchy during one time slot:

The MA is responsible for modelling hierarchical market operations, as follows:

*   **Forwarding** bids and offers from a lower hierarchy (market) to an upper hierarchy.
*   **Reacting** to bids, offers and trades reported by MAs in connected markets, in order to propagate the event for an offer/bid that has been forwarded from this MA.
*   Triggering the **matching** of bids and offers for the two-sided market.

To prioritize local trades, MAs forward bids and offers to higher/lower markets with a [two-tick](markets.md#market-ticks) delay.
