The bids and offers can be posted within the market cycle at each tick until the cycle ends. Figure 5.4 : Market slot overall structure and Asset API events. At the beginning of each market slot, the Asset API receives markets and assets information structured in a nested dictionary according to the grid hierarchy. Each market provides statistics such as minimum, median and maximum trade rates, total energy volume traded, grid fees and each asset returns the last bills and energy volume traded in the previous market slot. At each tick of the market slot, the Asset API receives updated asset information (e.g. remaining energy to buy/sell) and can post/update/delete bids and offers. When the trade occurs, trade details are sent by the Asset API. If there are unmatched bids or offers, they are not carried to the next market cycle. In order to facilitate bid and offer management and scheduling, a python file with the class Oracle is provided. The Oracle class acts as an information aggregator for all of the energy assets (e.g. loads, PVs and storage) managed by the user, and allows the user to post bids and offers on their behalf.

The return values have the following structure: { 'slo t _comple t io n ' : ' 0 %' , 'marke t _slo t ' : ' 2014-10-01 T 00 : 15 ' , 'grid_ tree ' : { ' 477999 f 1- f d 6e-4 c 68-8 cc 8-e8e52049 de 8e ' : { 'las t _marke t _bill' : { 'accumula te d_ tra des' : {}, 'ex ternal _ tra des' : {}}, 'las t _marke t _s tats ' : { 'mi n _ tra de_ra te ' : 26.0 , 'max_ tra de_ra te ' : 26.0 , 'avg_ tra de_ra te ' : 26.0 , 'media n _ tra de_ra te ' : 26.0 , ' t o tal _ tra ded_e ner gy_kWh' : 7.5239405 }, 'las t _marke t _ fee ' : 4 , 'curre nt _marke t _ fee ' : 4 , 'area_ na me' : 'Grid' , 'childre n ' : { ' f 02313 bb -16 c 4-427 b -90 d 2- d 753822 fe 21 c' : { 'las t _marke t _bill' : { 'accumula te d_ tra des' : {}, 'ex ternal _ tra des' : {}}, 'las t _marke t _s tats ' : { 'mi n _ tra de_ra te ' : 30.0 , 'max_ tra de_ra te ' : 30.0 , 'avg_ tra de_ra te ' : 30.0 , 'media n _ tra de_ra te ' : 30.0 , ' t o tal _ tra ded_e ner gy_kWh' : 7.5239405 }, 'las t _marke t _ fee ' : 4 , 'curre nt _marke t _ fee ' : 4 , 'area_ na me' : 'Commu n i t y' , 'childre n ' : { ' 44 d 19495-39e8-42e0- be 2 f -0432e644e5e5 ' : { 'las t _marke t _bill' : { 'accumula te d_ tra des' : {}, 'ex ternal _ tra des' : {}}, 'las t _marke t _s tats ' : { 'mi n _ tra de_ra te ' : No ne , 'max_ tra de_ra te ' : No ne , 'avg_ tra de_ra te ' : No ne , 'media n _ tra de_ra te ' : No ne , ' t o tal _ tra ded_e ner gy_kWh' : No ne }, 'las t _marke t _ fee ' : 0.0 , 'curre nt _marke t _ fee ' : No ne , 'area_ na me' : 'Member 1 ' , 'childre n ' : { ' 075834 dd -5438-4287-8393-781 a 4 a 8068 f 5 ' : { 'asse t _i nf o' : { 'e ner gy_requireme nt _kWh' : 0.06802025 , 'e ner gy_ac t ive_i n _bids' : 0.0 , 'e ner gy_ tra ded' : 0.0 , ' t o tal _cos t ' : 0.0 }, 'las t _slo t _asse t _i nf o' : { 'e ner gy_ tra ded' : 0.0 , ' t o tal _cos t ' : 0.0 }, 'asse t _bill' : {}, 'area_ na me' : 'Load 1 ' }, ' 2e7866 d 8-34 c 6-49 ad - a 388- f d 5876 a 3e679 ' : { 'asse t _i nf o' : { 'available_e ner gy_kWh' : 0.0 , 'e ner gy_ac t ive_i n _o ffers ' : 0 , 'e ner gy_ tra ded' : 0 , ' t o tal _cos t ' : 0 }, 'las t _slo t _asse t _i nf o' : { 'e ner gy_ tra ded' : 0 , ' t o tal _cos t ' : 0 }, 'asse t _bill' : {}, 'area_ na me' : 'PV 1 ' }, ' 22 c 495 b 2-4 b 2 b -43 ba -8 c 76-3e b 956014975 ' : { 'asse t _i nf o' : { 'e ner gy_ t o_sell' : 0.0 , 'e ner gy_ac t ive_i n _bids' : 0 , 'e ner gy_ t o_buy' : 1.36275 , 'e ner gy_ac t ive_i n _o ffers ' : 0 , ' free _s t orage' : 10.0 , 'used_s t orage' : 0.0 , 'e ner gy_ tra ded' : 0.0 , ' t o tal _cos t ' : 0.0 }, 'las t _slo t _asse t _i nf o' : { 'e ner gy_ tra ded' : 0.0 , ' t o tal _cos t ' : 0.0 }, 'asse t _bill' : {}, 'area_ na me' : 'S t orage 1 ' }}}, ' 5 c 0 c 05 dd -2e23-4866- a 113-e08797 a 2094e ' : { 'las t _marke t _bill' : { 'accumula te d_ tra des' : {}, 'ex ternal _ tra des' : {}}, 'las t _marke t _s tats ' : { 'mi n _ tra de_ra te ' : 30.0 , 'max_ tra de_ra te ' : 30.0 , 'avg_ tra de_ra te ' : 30.0 , 'media n _ tra de_ra te ' : 30.0 , ' t o tal _ tra ded_e ner gy_kWh' : 0.064779 }, 'las t _marke t _ fee ' : 0.0 , 'curre nt _marke t _ fee ' : No ne , ' fee d_i n _ tar i ff _ra te ' : 21.9 , 'marke t _maker_ra te ' : 22 , 'eve nt ' : 'marke t ' , ' nu m_ t icks' : 10.0 , 'simula t io n _id' : No ne ' fee d_i n _ tar i ff _ra te ' : 21.9 , 'marke t _maker_ra te ' : 22 , 'eve nt ' : 'marke t ' , ' nu m_ t icks' : 10.0 , 'simula t io n _id' : No ne }", "title": "Each new market slot"}, {"location": "asset-api-events/#on-of-market-completion", "text": "def on_tick(self, tick_info): At each 10% of market slot completion (e.g. 10%, 20%, 30%, \u2026), the same information as market_info will be passed, with updated asset energy requirements based on trades.

In this section, each script will be described along with its functionalities, in order of complexity. Post bids and offers to the Grid Singularity Exchange \u00b6 The key functionality of the Asset API is to post bids or offers to the Grid Singularity Exchange on behalf of energy asset owners based on their preferences. A template script can be found here . Users need to list the names of the assets to be connected with the Asset API, as shown in the following example. For simulations launched from the user-interface (UI), the CONNECT_TO_ALL_ASSETS parameter is available. If set to True, the Asset API connects automatically to all the assets the aggregator is connected to. # List of assets' names to be connected with the API LOAD_NAMES = [ \"Load 1 L13\" , \"Load 2 L21\" , \"Load 3 L17\" ] PV_NAMES = [ \"PV 1 (4kW)\" , \"PV 3 (5kW)\" ] STORAGE_NAMES = [ \"Tesla Powerwall 3\" ] CONNECT_TO_ALL_ASSETS = True The goal of this template script is to send, at each market slot , a bid and/or an offer for each energy asset. This is performed by the post_bid_offer function, which loops through all the assets connected with the Asset API, extracts their required or available energy and posts these values along with an associated rate for clearance and settlement by the Grid Singularity Exchange. As shown in the snippet below, the process is separated for consumption, generation and storage assets. def post_bid_offer ( self ): \"\"\"Post a bid or an offer to the exchange.\"\"\" for area_uuid , area_dict in self . latest_grid_tree_flat . items (): asset_info = area_dict . get ( \"asset_info\" ) if not asset_info : continue # Consumption assets required_energy = asset_info . get ( \"energy_requirement_kWh\" ) if required_energy : self . add_to_batch_commands . bid_energy_rate ( asset_uuid = area_uuid , rate = 10 , energy = required_energy ) # Generation assets available_energy = asset_info . get ( \"available_energy_kWh\" ) if available_energy : self . add_to_batch_commands . offer_energy_rate ( asset_uuid = area_uuid , rate = 10 , energy = available_energy ) # Storage assets buy_energy = asset_info . get ( \"energy_to_buy\" ) if buy_energy : self . add_to_batch_commands . bid_energy_rate ( asset_uuid = area_uuid , rate = 10 , energy = buy_energy ) sell_energy = asset_info . get ( \"energy_to_sell\" ) if sell_energy : self . add_to_batch_commands . offer_energy_rate ( asset_uuid = area_uuid , rate = 10 , energy = sell_energy ) self . execute_batch_commands () Later in the script, the on_event_or_response is called. By default, the Asset API template does not perform any operation here but the user can add events . For instance, the user could record all the trades occurring in that event. Lastly, the script overwrites the on_finish event so that when this function is triggered, the script stops. If the user wishes to save any information reported in the logs, this can be done by exporting it to an external file. def on_event_or_response ( self , message ): pass def on_finish ( self , finish_info ): self . is_finished = True The rest of the script is used to connect to the energy assets of a running simulation / collaboration / Canary Test Network , with the purpose of actively placing bids and offers on their behalf. aggregator = Oracle ( aggregator_name = ORACLE_NAME ) simulation_id = os . environ [ \"API_CLIENT_SIMULATION_ID\" ] domain_name = os . environ [ \"API_CLIENT_DOMAIN_NAME\" ] websockets_domain_name = os . environ [ \"API_CLIENT_WEBSOCKET_DOMAIN_NAME\" ] asset_args = { \"autoregister\" : False , \"start_websocket\" : False } if CONNECT_TO_ALL_ASSETS : registry = aggregator . get_configuration_registry () registered_assets = get_assets_name ( registry ) LOAD_NAMES = registered_assets [ \"Load\" ] PV_NAMES = registered_assets [ \"PV\" ] STORAGE_NAMES = registered_assets [ \"Storage\" ] def register_asset_list ( asset_names : List , asset_params : Dict , asset_uuid_map : Dict ) -> Dict : \"\"\"Register the provided list of assets with the aggregator.\"\"\" for asset_name in asset_names : print ( \"Registered asset:\" , asset_name ) uuid = get_area_uuid_from_area_name_and_collaboration_id ( simulation_id , asset_name , domain_name ) asset_params [ \"asset_uuid\" ] = uuid asset_uuid_map [ uuid ] = asset_name asset = RestAssetClient ( ** asset_params ) asset . select_aggregator ( aggregator . aggregator_uuid ) return asset_uuid_map print () print ( \"Registering assets ...\" ) asset_uuid_mapping = {} asset_uuid_mapping = register_asset_list ( LOAD_NAMES + PV_NAMES + STORAGE_NAMES , asset_args , asset_uuid_mapping ) print () print ( \"Summary of assets registered:\" ) print () print ( asset_uuid_mapping ) # loop to allow persistence while not aggregator . is_finished : sleep ( 0.5 ) For simulations run in the backend, a similar script is available here . Implement trading strategies \u00b6 One of the main functionalities provided by the Asset API is to implement customized trading strategies. The Asset API script stores energy assets information such as the energy requirements for the loads , the energy available for the PVs and the State of Charge for the storage . This information when aggregated could be valuable when designing a smarter trading strategy. A template script can be found here . At the beginning of the on_market_slot event, the script generates the trading strategies (in the build_strategies function). The Market Maker price and the Feed-in Tariff values are required to set the pricing boundaries for the trading strategy. fit_rate = market_info [ \"feed_in_tariff_rate\" ] market_maker_rate = market_info [ \"market_maker_rate\" ] med_price = ( market_maker_rate - fit_rate ) / 2 + fit_rate Then, the script creates the asset_strategy dictionary, which contains various information for each asset, such as its name, its type (load, PV or storage) and the grid fees between the assets and the market maker. To calculate the grid fees between two assets or markets in the grid, the calculate_grid_fee function is used,which takes 3 arguments: start_market_or_asset_name : UUID of the started market/asset target_market_or_asset_name : UUID of the targeted market/asset fee_type : can either be \"current_market_fee\" or \u201clast_market_fee\u201d The fees are integrated in the pricing strategy in order to avoid any power outages for the loads or PV curtailment. for area_uuid , area_dict in self . latest_grid_tree_flat . items (): if \"asset_info\" not in area_dict or area_dict [ \"asset_info\" ] is None : continue self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ] = {} self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"asset_name\" ] = area_dict [ \"area_name\" ] self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ] = self . calculate_grid_fee ( area_uuid , self . get_uuid_from_area_name ( \"Market Maker\" ), \"current_market_fee\" , ) Lastly, in the asset_strategy dictionary, the pricing strategy is defined for each asset individually. This allows assets to have independent strategies depending on the available market information and their location in the grid. The current pricing strategies are deterministic, representing a linear function bounded between the Feed-in Tariff - grid fee (lower boundary) and the Market Maker price + grid fee (upper boundary). Since the Asset API can post bids/offers at every tick, the number of posts is limited to the number of ticks in the market slot. In the template strategy, bids are ramped up and offers are ramped down for a total of 10 prices per energy asset. This can be configured by setting the TICK_DISPATCH_FREQUENCY_PERCENT parameter (at the top of the script). The final bid/offer price is set at 80% market slot completion in order for the update to be visible by all other market participants. The load strategy, the PV strategy and the storage strategy, representing assets that can charge and discharge and therefore place bids and offers at the same time, are designed as follows. # Consumption strategy if \"energy_requirement_kWh\" in area_dict [ \"asset_info\" ]: load_strategy = [] for tick in range ( 0 , TICKS ): if tick < TICKS - 2 : buy_rate = ( fit_rate - self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ] + ( market_maker_rate + 2 * self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ] - fit_rate ) * ( tick / TICKS ) ) load_strategy . append ( buy_rate ) else : buy_rate = market_maker_rate + ( self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ]) load_strategy . append ( buy_rate ) self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"buy_rates\" ] = load_strategy # Generation strategy if \"available_energy_kWh\" in area_dict [ \"asset_info\" ]: gen_strategy = [] for tick in range ( 0 , TICKS ): if tick < TICKS - 2 : sell_rate = ( market_maker_rate + self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ] - ( market_maker_rate + 2 * self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ] - fit_rate ) * ( tick / TICKS ) ) gen_strategy . append ( max ( 0 , sell_rate )) else : sell_rate = fit_rate - ( self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ]) gen_strategy . append ( max ( 0 , sell_rate )) self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"sell_rates\" ] = gen_strategy # Storage strategy if \"used_storage\" in area_dict [ \"asset_info\" ]: batt_buy_strategy = [] batt_sell_strategy = [] for tick in range ( 0 , TICKS ): buy_rate = ( fit_rate - self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ] + ( med_price - ( fit_rate - self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ] ) ) * ( tick / TICKS ) ) batt_buy_strategy . append ( buy_rate ) sell_rate = ( market_maker_rate + self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ] - ( market_maker_rate + self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ] - med_price ) * ( tick / TICKS ) ) batt_sell_strategy . append ( sell_rate ) self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"buy_rates\" ] = batt_buy_strategy self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"sell_rates\" ] = batt_sell_strategy At each on_tick event, the Asset API will post new bids and offers, or update / delete existing ones. This allows the Exchange SDK to update their price strategy until all consumption and generation have been traded. In the following lines the Exchange SDK updates the existing bids/offers with new prices to optimize trades. The updated energy information is found in latest_grid_tree_flat.items() and the prices for each bid/offer depend on the market slot progression. All the commands are then executed. def post_bid_offer ( self , rate_index = 0 ): \"\"\"Post a bid or an offer to the exchange.\"\"\" for area_uuid , area_dict in self . latest_grid_tree_flat . items (): asset_info = area_dict . get ( \"asset_info\" ) if not asset_info : continue # Consumption assets required_energy = asset_info . get ( \"energy_requirement_kWh\" ) if required_energy : rate = self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"buy_rates\" ][ rate_index ] self . add_to_batch_commands . bid_energy_rate ( asset_uuid = area_uuid , rate = rate , energy = required_energy ) # Generation assets available_energy = asset_info . get ( \"available_energy_kWh\" ) if available_energy : rate = self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"sell_rates\" ][ rate_index ] self . add_to_batch_commands . offer_energy_rate ( asset_uuid = area_uuid , rate = rate , energy = available_energy ) # Storage assets buy_energy = asset_info . get ( \"energy_to_buy\" ) if buy_energy : buy_rate = self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"buy_rates\" ][ rate_index ] self . add_to_batch_commands . bid_energy_rate ( asset_uuid = area_uuid , rate = buy_rate , energy = buy_energy ) sell_energy = asset_info . get ( \"energy_to_sell\" ) if sell_energy : sell_rate = self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"sell_rates\" ][ rate_index ] self . add_to_batch_commands . offer_energy_rate ( asset_uuid = area_uuid , rate = sell_rate , energy = sell_energy ) self . execute_batch_commands () The rest of the script functionality has been covered in the previous section . For simulations run in the backend, a similar script is available here . Introduce trading preferences with the Degrees of Freedom \u00b6 With the Asset API, users also have the option to specify trading preferences for each asset, such as preferred trading partners, energy type, energy amount and rate. An example of such a script can be found here . These preferences are also known as requirements and attributes or \u201cdegrees of freedom\u201d, as explained here . Requirements are uploaded to the template script via a JSON file (an example can be found here ), which has the following structure: { \"Load 3 L17\" :[ { \"Trading Partners\" : [ \"PV 9 (15kW)\" ], \"Energy Types\" : [], \"Energy\" : \"None\" , \"Rate\" : \"None\" } ], \"Load 2 L21\" :[ { \"Trading Partners\" : [ \"PV 5 (10kW)\" ], \"Energy Types\" : [], \"Energy\" : 10 , \"Rate\" : 3 } ], \"Load 1 L13\" :[ { \"Trading Partners\" : [], \"Energy Types\" : [], \"Energy\" : \"None\" , \"Rate\" : \"None\" } ] } In this example it is shown how, for each load, the four above mentioned requirements are listed and specified in value. It is also possible not to set any specific requirement to an asset, as for Load 1 L13. If, for example, \u201cEnergy\u201d and \u201cRate\u201d are set to None, the default energy and rate values from the template trading strategies are assigned. At each market slot , the Asset API loads and reads the information contained in this JSON file with the following function: def read_requirements ( self ): \"\"\"Load the JSON file containing the list of requirements for each asset.\"\"\" with open ( os . path . join ( module_dir , \"resources/requirements.json\" ), \"r\" , encoding = \"utf-8\" , ) as file : self . degrees_of_freedom = json . load ( file ) Subsequently, a bid with the associated requirements is posted to the Exchange (for more on how to post bids and offers please see here .) The requirements uploaded through the JSON file must be converted to the correct format ahead of submission to the Exchange. To do so, the build_requirements_dict function is used: def build_requirements_dict ( self , rate , energy , area_name ): \"\"\"Return a dictionary with the requirements of the asset.\"\"\" asset_dof_list = self . degrees_of_freedom [ area_name ] for asset_dof in asset_dof_list : id_trading_partners_list = get_partner_ids ( asset_dof [ \"Trading Partners\" ]) energy_types_list = asset_dof [ \"Energy Types\" ] energy_requirement = ( energy if asset_dof [ \"Energy\" ] == \"None\" else min ( asset_dof [ \"Energy\" ], energy ) ) rate_requirement = ( rate if asset_dof [ \"Rate\" ] == \"None\" else asset_dof [ \"Rate\" ] ) requirements = [ { \"trading_partners\" : id_trading_partners_list , \"energy_type\" : energy_types_list , \"energy\" : energy_requirement , \"price\" : rate_requirement * energy_requirement , } ] return requirements The rest of the script functionality has been covered in the previous section . It is important to note that currently there is no available template script for introducing degrees of freedom from the UI, but solely from the backend . Send live data to a Canary Test Network \u00b6 As noted here , the Asset API has the functionality to send live data to Grid Singularity Canary Test Network . A template script can be found here . To do so, at each market slot , forecast for the next 15 minutes are sent through the following function: def send_forecasts ( self , market_info ): \"\"\"Send forecasts of the next market slot to the exchange.\"\"\" forecast_market_slot = ( from_format ( market_info [ \"market_slot\" ], DATE_TIME_FORMAT ) . add ( minutes = 15 ) . format ( DATE_TIME_FORMAT ) ) # pylint: disable=unused-variable for area_uuid , area_dict in self . latest_grid_tree_flat . items (): asset_info = area_dict . get ( \"asset_info\" ) if not asset_info : continue # Consumption assets if \"energy_requirement_kWh\" in asset_info : asset_name = area_dict [ \"area_name\" ] globals ()[ f \" { asset_name } \" ] . set_energy_forecast ( energy_forecast_kWh = { forecast_market_slot : 1.2 }, do_not_wait = False , ) # Generation assets if \"available_energy_kWh\" in asset_info : asset_name = area_dict [ \"area_name\" ] globals ()[ f \" { asset_name } \" ] . set_energy_forecast ( energy_forecast_kWh = { forecast_market_slot : 0.86 }, do_not_wait = False , ) self . execute_batch_commands () The forecast_market_slot , namely the marker slot at which the forecasted value is sent, is first retrieved by the market_info dictionary. Then, the set_energy_forecast function is used to send consumption / generation forecasted values to the Grid Singularity Exchange. In this example, 1.2 kWh are sent as consumption forecasts and 0.86 kWh are sent as generation forecasts. The rest of the script functionality has been covered in the previous section . Post energy deviations in the Settlement Market \u00b6 Finally, the Asset API can also be used to post energy deviations between forecasts (namely the values of consumption or generation that an asset was expected to consume or produce) and measurements (namely the actual consumption or generation values) in the Settlement Market . A template script can be found here . As noted in the previous section, users can send forecasts (generated by assets or other data source) to the Grid Singularity Exchange by using the Asset API. To settle energy deviations in the Settlement Market, further action is needed, which is to send measurements to the Exchange at each market slot by using the following function: def send_measurements ( self , market_info ): \"\"\"Send measurements for the current market slot to the exchange.\"\"\" # pylint: disable=unused-variable for area_uuid , area_dict in self . latest_grid_tree_flat . items (): if \"asset_info\" not in area_dict or area_dict [ \"asset_info\" ] is None : continue # Consumption assets if \"energy_requirement_kWh\" in area_dict [ \"asset_info\" ]: self . add_to_batch_commands . set_energy_measurement ( asset_uuid = area_uuid , energy_measurement_kWh = { market_info [ \"market_slot\" ]: 1.23 }, ) # Generation assets if \"available_energy_kWh\" in area_dict [ \"asset_info\" ]: self . add_to_batch_commands . set_energy_measurement ( asset_uuid = area_uuid , energy_measurement_kWh = { market_info [ \"market_slot\" ]: 0.87 }, ) As shown in the snippet above, set_energy_measurement is used to send values to the Exchange which, in this example, are sent to the current market slot. Later, in settle_energy_deviation , the Asset API computes the difference between the forecast and measured values, called in the script unsettled_deviation . Depending on whether this value is positive or negative, a bid or an offer will be posted in the Settlement Market. The rate, as well as the time slot for order placement can be arbitrarily set by the user. Below is the snippet of the described function: def settle_energy_deviations ( self ): \"\"\"Post the energy deviations between forecasts and measurements in the Settlement market.\"\"\" for area_uuid , area_dict in self . latest_grid_tree_flat . items (): if not area_dict . get ( \"asset_info\" ): continue time_slot = ( list ( area_dict [ \"asset_info\" ][ \"unsettled_deviation_kWh\" ] . keys ())[ - 1 ]) unsettled_deviation = area_dict [ \"asset_info\" ][ \"unsettled_deviation_kWh\" ] . get ( time_slot ) if unsettled_deviation > 0 : self . add_to_batch_commands . bid_energy_rate ( asset_uuid = area_uuid , rate = 5 , energy = unsettled_deviation , time_slot = time_slot , ) if unsettled_deviation < 0 : self . add_to_batch_commands . offer_energy_rate ( asset_uuid = area_uuid , rate = 10 , energy = abs ( unsettled_deviation ), time_slot = time_slot , ) The rest of the script functionality has been covered in the previous section . It is important to note that currently there is no available template script for interacting with the Settlement Market from the UI, but solely from the backend . The next step is to adapt the Asset API template scripts developed by Grid Singularity to customize your trading strategies, whether to send live data to the Grid Singularity Canary Test Network or to interact with the Settlement Market .", "title": "Asset API Template Script"}, {"location": "asset-api-template-script/#post-bids-and-offers-to-the-grid-singularity-exchange", "text": "The key functionality of the Asset API is to post bids or offers to the Grid Singularity Exchange on behalf of energy asset owners based on their preferences.

The Asset API script stores energy assets information such as the energy requirements for the loads , the energy available for the PVs and the State of Charge for the storage . This information when aggregated could be valuable when designing a smarter trading strategy. A template script can be found here . At the beginning of the on_market_slot event, the script generates the trading strategies (in the build_strategies function). The Market Maker price and the Feed-in Tariff values are required to set the pricing boundaries for the trading strategy. fit_rate = market_info [ \"feed_in_tariff_rate\" ] market_maker_rate = market_info [ \"market_maker_rate\" ] med_price = ( market_maker_rate - fit_rate ) / 2 + fit_rate Then, the script creates the asset_strategy dictionary, which contains various information for each asset, such as its name, its type (load, PV or storage) and the grid fees between the assets and the market maker. To calculate the grid fees between two assets or markets in the grid, the calculate_grid_fee function is used,which takes 3 arguments: start_market_or_asset_name : UUID of the started market/asset target_market_or_asset_name : UUID of the targeted market/asset fee_type : can either be \"current_market_fee\" or \u201clast_market_fee\u201d The fees are integrated in the pricing strategy in order to avoid any power outages for the loads or PV curtailment. for area_uuid , area_dict in self . latest_grid_tree_flat . items (): if \"asset_info\" not in area_dict or area_dict [ \"asset_info\" ] is None : continue self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ] = {} self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"asset_name\" ] = area_dict [ \"area_name\" ] self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ] = self . calculate_grid_fee ( area_uuid , self . get_uuid_from_area_name ( \"Market Maker\" ), \"current_market_fee\" , ) Lastly, in the asset_strategy dictionary, the pricing strategy is defined for each asset individually. This allows assets to have independent strategies depending on the available market information and their location in the grid. The current pricing strategies are deterministic, representing a linear function bounded between the Feed-in Tariff - grid fee (lower boundary) and the Market Maker price + grid fee (upper boundary). Since the Asset API can post bids/offers at every tick, the number of posts is limited to the number of ticks in the market slot. In the template strategy, bids are ramped up and offers are ramped down for a total of 10 prices per energy asset. This can be configured by setting the TICK_DISPATCH_FREQUENCY_PERCENT parameter (at the top of the script). The final bid/offer price is set at 80% market slot completion in order for the update to be visible by all other market participants. The load strategy, the PV strategy and the storage strategy, representing assets that can charge and discharge and therefore place bids and offers at the same time, are designed as follows. # Consumption strategy if \"energy_requirement_kWh\" in area_dict [ \"asset_info\" ]: load_strategy = [] for tick in range ( 0 , TICKS ): if tick < TICKS - 2 : buy_rate = ( fit_rate - self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ] + ( market_maker_rate + 2 * self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ] - fit_rate ) * ( tick / TICKS ) ) load_strategy . append ( buy_rate ) else : buy_rate = market_maker_rate + ( self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ]) load_strategy . append ( buy_rate ) self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"buy_rates\" ] = load_strategy # Generation strategy if \"available_energy_kWh\" in area_dict [ \"asset_info\" ]: gen_strategy = [] for tick in range ( 0 , TICKS ): if tick < TICKS - 2 : sell_rate = ( market_maker_rate + self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ] - ( market_maker_rate + 2 * self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ] - fit_rate ) * ( tick / TICKS ) ) gen_strategy . append ( max ( 0 , sell_rate )) else : sell_rate = fit_rate - ( self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ]) gen_strategy . append ( max ( 0 , sell_rate )) self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"sell_rates\" ] = gen_strategy # Storage strategy if \"used_storage\" in area_dict [ \"asset_info\" ]: batt_buy_strategy = [] batt_sell_strategy = [] for tick in range ( 0 , TICKS ): buy_rate = ( fit_rate - self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ] + ( med_price - ( fit_rate - self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ] ) ) * ( tick / TICKS ) ) batt_buy_strategy . append ( buy_rate ) sell_rate = ( market_maker_rate + self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ] - ( market_maker_rate + self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"fee_to_market_maker\" ] - med_price ) * ( tick / TICKS ) ) batt_sell_strategy . append ( sell_rate ) self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"buy_rates\" ] = batt_buy_strategy self . asset_strategy [ area_uuid ][ \"sell_rates\" ] = batt_sell_strategy At each on_tick event, the Asset API will post new bids and offers, or update / delete existing ones. This allows the Exchange SDK to update their price strategy until all consumption and generation have been traded. In the following lines the Exchange SDK updates the existing bids/offers with new prices to optimize trades.

The Market Maker asset strategy in the infinite power plant mode is configured as follows: Asset ( 'Market Maker' , strategy = MarketMakerStrategy ( energy_rate , energy_rate_profile , grid_connected )) Where energy_rate is the input for a constant buying rate and energy_rate_profile the input for a variable buying rate. With the grid_connected parameter the user can toggle if the asset is connected to the grid or if it should only dictate the highest energy rate in the grid (islanded mode). Infinite bus (in this mode, the Market Maker has not only the ability to meet the infinite energy demand of the consumer but can also absorb the infinite generation surplus of prosumers/producers at the lowest rate possible in that grid). The Market Maker asset strategy in the infinite bus mode is configured as follows: Asset ( 'Market Maker' , strategy = InfiniteBusStrategy ( energy_buy_rate , energy_rate_profile , energy_sell_rate , buying_rate_profile )) Where energy_buy_rate and energy_sell_rate are inputs for constant rates and energy_rate_profile and buying_rate_profile the inputs for variable rates. Addendum: Storage Capacity Based Method. \u00b6 This method was created to sell energy at lower prices during high state of charge - SOC (when the battery has more energy stored) and at higher prices during low SOC (when the battery can afford to sell its stored energy for less). If the cap_price_strategy is True, the offer price for the storage is calculated according to: offer_rate = initial_selling_rate - ((initial_selling_rate - final_selling_rate)\\*soc/100) As an example, considering an initial_selling_rate of 30 cts/kWh and a final_selling_rate of 20 cts/kWh, a storage with an SOC of 1% would sell its energy at 29.9 cts/kWh, and a battery at 100% SOC would sell its energy at 20 cts/kWh.

An event has to be associated with a market or an asset by using the event_list constructor parameter for that Market or Asset class. There are four different event types, described in further detail below: Add/Remove Market Events Connect/Disconnect Market Events Strategy Events Add/Remove Market Events \u00b6 This event is associated with a market, and dictates that this market (and its submarkets and assets) will be added or removed from the grid at a specific point in time. There are two ways to configure this operation, either via individual events ( EnableMarketEvent and DisableMarketEvent ) or by disabling this market for a selected time interval ( DisableIntervalMarketEvent ). EnableMarketEvent / DisableMarketEvent commands each accept one argument, which is the hour at which this event is triggered (hourly resolution is supported in the current implementation), and this area will be enabled/disabled at this specific point in time no matter its current state. DisableIntervalMarketEvent accepts two arguments, denoting the start hour and the end hour at which the Market is disabled. The term disabled market means that the relevant markets and submarkets are not performing any trading, and are hence inactive in the simulation for the time that the market is disabled. Once enabled, the relevant market and its submarkets will start to operate. Examples for these events are available on the Grid Singularity GitHub: EnableMarketEvent: isolated_enable_event.py DisableMarketEvent: isolated_disable_event.py DisableIntervalMarketEvent: disable_interval_event.py Connect/Disconnect Market Events \u00b6 These events are similar to the enable/disable event; both have a similar API and both are used for removing a market from the grid. The difference is that the Connect/Disconnect events are decoupling the relevant submarkets and assets from the main grid. When the event is enabled, there will be two independent grids trading energy internally, but not with each other. This is contrary to enable/disable events, where the subtree is not performing any trades. This can simulate grids that are abruptly decoupled from the main grid, but manage to self-sustain their assets by continuing to trade energy even after they are disconnected from the main grid. You can find examples for these events on Grid Singularity GitHub: ConnectMarketEvent: isolated_connect_event.py DisconnectMarketEvent: isolated_disconnect_event.py DisconnectIntervalMarketEvent: disconnect_interval_event.py Strategy Events \u00b6 These events are used to change an asset\u2019s trading strategy during the simulation runtime.

It is the fastest type of frequency control with a response time of a few seconds and operates using a joint process involving all TSOs of the synchronous area. This is shown in the figure below. For example, if there is an increase in demand, the energy used to compensate for this demand comes from the kinetic energy stored in large rotating synchronous generators that start decreasing its velocity. This is referred to as Inertial response . For the generators to recover the speed, the speed controller of each generator acts to increase the generator power to clear the imbalance. Within a period of 30 seconds, each generating unit is able to generate the required power and stabilise this production for at least 15 minutes or depending on the requirements of the TSO within the synchronous region.

Setup your computer for Substrate development \u00b6 Please install Rust toolchain and the Developer Tools following the instructions from Substrate here . Run the GSY DEX code \u00b6 The cargo run command will perform an initial build. Use the following command to build the node without launching it: cd gsy-node cargo build --release Once the project has been built, the following command can be used to explore all parameters and subcommands: ./target/release/gsy-node -h The cargo run command will launch a temporary node and its state will be discarded after you terminate the process. This command will start the single-node development chain with persistent state. This is useful in order to not discard the state of the node once the node stops running: ./target/release/gsy-node --dev Purge the development chain's state: ./target/release/gsy-node purge-chain --dev Start the development chain with detailed logging: RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/gsy-node -ldebug --dev Integration with the current version of the GSY Energy Exchange is also possible, with the objective of modelling, simulation and optimisation of energy marketplaces. To install, please refer to these installation instructions . Once installation is completed, a new energy marketplace can be modelled following the instructions here . The same marketplace can also be simulated using the GSY DEX as the exchange engine. In order to switch to the GSY DEX and enable blockchain operations, the command-line flag --enable-bc should be used. The mnemonic of the GSY DEX account should also be provided, in order to authorise the exchange engine to restore your key when needed and interact as bids and offers\u2019 aggregator on your behalf with the blockchain. Finally, the ENABLE_SUBSTRATE parameter should be set to True. Co-develop the GSY DEX \u00b6 To develop and extend the GSY DEX features and applications please follow this guide, which is based on the rustup installer tool for Rust toolchain management. First install and configure rustup : # Install curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh # Configure source ~/.cargo/env Configure the Rust toolchain to default to the latest stable version, add nightly and the nightly wasm target: rustup default stable rustup update rustup update nightly rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly In order to test your setup, the best way to ensure that you have successfully prepared a computer for the GSY Node development is to follow the steps in the first Substrate tutorial . In order to run the code in developer mode, use Rust's native cargo command to build and launch the GSY Node : cd gsy-node cargo run --release -- --dev --tmp You should always use the --release flag to build optimised artifacts . The command-line options specify how you want the running node to operate. In this case, the --dev option specifies that the node runs in development mode using the predefined development chain specification. By default, this option also deletes all active data - such as keys, the blockchain database, and networking information when you stop the node by pressing Control-c. Using the --dev option ensures that you have a clean working state any time you stop and restart the node. Verify your node is up and running successfully by reviewing the output displayed in the terminal.

Connect external UI to the GSY DEX \u00b6 Once the node is running locally, you can connect it with the Polkadot-JS Apps User Interface to interact with the running node here . Run the GSY DEX code using Docker Compose \u00b6 First, install Docker and Docker Compose . Build and tag the docker image: docker build -t gsy_dex_image . docker tag gsy_dex_image:latest gsy_dex_image:staging and start docker-compose: docker-compose up Explore the GSY DEX code \u00b6 A blockchain node is an application that allows users to participate in a blockchain network. Substrate-based blockchain nodes ensure a number of capabilities: Networking: Substrate nodes use the libp2p networking stack to allow the nodes in the network to communicate with one another. Consensus: Blockchains need to reach consensus on the state of the network to validate transactions. Substrate facilitates custom consensus engines and includes a choice of consensus mechanisms built by the Web3 Foundation research community. RPC Server: A remote procedure call (RPC) server is used to interact with Substrate-based nodes. There are several files in the node directory - take special note of the following: - chain_spec.rs : A chain specification is a source code file that defines a Substrate chain's initial (genesis) state. Chain specifications are useful for development and testing, and critical when architecting the launch of a production chain. Take note of the development_config and testnet_genesis functions, which are used to define the genesis state for the local development chain configuration. These functions identify some well-known accounts and use them to configure the blockchain's initial state. - service.rs : This file defines the node implementation. Take note of the libraries that this file imports and the names of the functions it invokes. In particular, there are references to consensus-related topics, such as the longest chain rule , the Aura block authoring mechanism and the GRANDPA finality gadget. After the node has been built, refer to the embedded documentation to learn more about the capabilities and configuration parameters it facilitates: ./target/release/gsy-node --help Runtime \u00b6 In Substrate, the terms \" runtime \" and \" state transition function \" are analogous and refer to the core logic of the blockchain that is responsible for validating blocks and executing the state changes. The gsy-node Rust package in this repository uses the FRAME framework to construct a blockchain runtime. FRAME allows runtime developers to declare domain-specific logic in modules called \"pallets\". At the heart of FRAME is helpful macro language that makes it easy to create and flexibly compose pallets to generate blockchains that can address a variety of needs . Review the FRAME runtime implementation included in the node source code ./runtime/src/lib.rs and note the following: This file configures several pallets to include in the runtime. Each pallet configuration is defined by a code block that begins with impl $PALLET_NAME::Config for Runtime . The pallets are composed into a single runtime by way of the construct_runtime! macro, which is part of the core FRAME Support library . Pallets \u00b6 The runtime in this project is constructed using many FRAME pallets that ship with the core Substrate repository and orderbook-registry , orderbook-worker and trades-settlement pallets that are defined in the ./modules directory. A FRAME pallet is comprised of a number of blockchain primitives: Storage: FRAME defines a rich set of powerful storage abstractions that makes it easy to use Substrate's efficient key-value database to manage the evolving state of a blockchain. Dispatchables: FRAME pallets define special types of functions that can be invoked (dispatched) from outside of the runtime in order to update its state. Events: Substrate uses events and errors to notify users of important changes in the runtime. Errors: When a dispatchable fails, it returns an error. Config: The Config configuration interface is used to define the types and parameters upon which a FRAME pallet depends. Order Book Registry Pallet \u00b6 The Order Book Registry pallet provides a decentralised order book management system that allows users to register accounts, insert and delete orders, and manage proxies for delegating order management. Pallet Overview \u00b6 The pallet provides several key components: 1. User and Matching Engine Operator registration. 2. Proxy account management for users. 3. Order management, including insertion and deletion. Storage Items \u00b6 RegisteredUser : Maps an AccountId to a Hash for registered users.

GSY DEX Primitives \u00b6 The implemented Rust code defines the primitive data structures used in the GSY DEX, such as types for block numbers, moments, signatures, public keys, account IDs, account indices, chain IDs, hashes, nonces, balances, headers, blocks, and extrinsics. Additionally, it exports the OrderReference and OrderStatus types from the orders module . Here is an overview of the input data types for the GSY DEX: BlockNumber : a type alias for a 64-bit unsigned integer used to represent block numbers Moment : a type alias for a 64-bit unsigned integer used to represent an instant or duration in time Signature : a type alias for the MultiSignature type from the sp_runtime module. This type is used to represent a signature for a transaction. It allows one of several underlying cryptographic algorithms to be used, so it isn't a fixed size when encoded. AccountPublic : a type alias for the Signer associated type of the Verify trait implemented for Signature . This type represents the public key used for the GSY Node and is actually a MultiSigner . Like the signature, this type also isn't a fixed size when encoded, as different cryptographic algorithms have different size public keys. AccountId : a type alias for the AccountId32 type associated with the IdentifyAccount trait implemented for AccountPublic . This type is an opaque account ID type and is always 32 bytes. AccountIndex : a type alias for a 32-bit unsigned integer used to represent the type for looking up accounts. ChainId : a type alias for a 32-bit unsigned integer used to represent the identifier for a chain. Hash : a type alias for the H256 type from the sp_core module. This type is used to represent a hash of arbitrary data objects (e.g. asset identifiers, orderbook identifiers). Nonce : a type alias for a 32-bit unsigned integer used to represent the index of a transaction. Balance : a type alias for a 128-bit unsigned integer used to represent the balance of an account. Header : a type alias for the generic::Header<BlockNumber, BlakeTwo256> type from the sp_runtime module. This type represents the header of a block. Block : a type alias for the generic::Block<Header, UncheckedExtrinsic> type from the sp_runtime module. This type represents a block. BlockId : a type alias for the generic::BlockId<Block> type from the sp_runtime module. This type represents the ID of a block. UncheckedExtrinsic : an opaque, encoded, unchecked extrinsic that is used to represent a transaction. OrderReference : a type defined in the orders module that represents a reference to a Bid or an Offer . OrderStatus : a type defined in the orders module that represents the status of a Bid or an Offer . mod orders : a module that exports the OrderReference and OrderStatus types. The Orders Module \u00b6 The orders module defines several types: Order : An enum representing the order in the GSY DEX, with two variants: Bid : A struct representing a bid order, including the buyer, nonce and the bid components. Offer : A struct representing an offer (ask) order, including the seller, nonce, and the offer components. OrderStatus : An enum that represents the status of an Order , with three variants: Open : The default status. Executed : The order has been executed. Deleted : The order has been cancelled. OrderReference : A struct that represents a reference to an Order in the GSY DEX, with two fields: user_id : The account ID of the user who created the order. hash : The hash of the order struct which represents a unique reference of the Order object. InputOrder : An enum representing the input format of the order of the GSY DEX. It has two variants: InputBid : A struct representing an input bid order, including the buyer and the bid components. InputOffer : A struct representing an input offer (ask) order, including the seller and the offer components. OrderComponent : A struct representing the common components of an order, including area UUID, market UUID, time slot, creation time, energy, and energy rate. OrderSchema : A struct representing the schema of the order. It is needed in order to enforce the order book storage and other ancillary services to use the same schema/protocol for the Order struct as the GSY Node . The Trades Module \u00b6 The trades module defines several types: Trade : A struct representing a trade, including the seller, buyer, market ID, trade UUID, creation time, time slot, offer, offer hash, bid, bid hash, residual offer, residual bid, and trade parameters. TradeParameters : A struct representing the trade parameters, including the selected energy, energy rate, and trade UUID. BidOfferMatch : A struct representing a bid and offer match, including the selected energy, energy rate, and trade UUID Validator : A trait defining the validation functions for the trades module.", "title": "GSY DEX Node Installation, Operation and Development"}, {"location": "blockchain-installation/#setup-your-computer-for-substrate-development", "text": "Please install Rust toolchain and the Developer Tools following the instructions from Substrate here .", "title": "Setup your computer for Substrate development"}, {"location": "blockchain-installation/#run-the-gsy-dex-code", "text": "The cargo run command will perform an initial build.

In order to run the code in developer mode, use Rust's native cargo command to build and launch the GSY Node : cd gsy-node cargo run --release -- --dev --tmp You should always use the --release flag to build optimised artifacts . The command-line options specify how you want the running node to operate. In this case, the --dev option specifies that the node runs in development mode using the predefined development chain specification. By default, this option also deletes all active data - such as keys, the blockchain database, and networking information when you stop the node by pressing Control-c. Using the --dev option ensures that you have a clean working state any time you stop and restart the node.

It integrates directly with the GSY Off-Chain Storage for real-time bid and offer access via its Order Book Storage, and with the GSY Node for trade settlement in conjunction with a trade execution (energy delivery) verification service provided by the GSY Execution Engine . The GSY Matching Engine deploys a pay-as-bid strategy, ensuring that buyers and sellers receive the best possible prices for their energy trades. Future versions will integrate pay-as-clear and automated market maker (AMM) as alternative trading mechanisms. Furthermore, the intent is to render the GSY Matching Engine available as an autonomous service application in the Energy Web SmartFlow Launchpad , leveraging the Energy Web infrastructure and facilitating integration with a wider range of third-party applications, even beyond the energy market. Multi-attribute auctions, which account for participant preferences and applicable market conditions, require more advanced clearing algorithms than single attribute auctions, such as those based on price alone. The optimal approach is to engage off-chain workers to operate matching algorithms and then require either the use of trusted execution environments (enclaves) or on-chain verification to determine whether the matching algorithm was correctly executed. To enable this solution, the matching process is decoupled from the settlement verification and moved to a dedicated component, the Matching Engine. The GSY DEX Matching Engine has been designed to operate as (one or multiple) individual autonomous service(s), responsible for identifying suitable matches for multiple open order books. In order to manage the available GSY Matching Engine services, the GSY Node needs to register each such service and associate it with a user account responsible for operating the respective service. Grid Singularity will facilitate the Matching Engine registration process for the GSY DEX . The GSY DEX Matching Engine reads open bids and offers through the GSY DEX Matching API and submits matches for validation based on the process determined for the Grid Singularity Exchange. Since the exchange\u2019s verification function (part of GSY Node) only checks the validity of each match rather than the result of a specific matching algorithm, there is no longer a need for an agreed matching algorithm, arbitration technique, or redundant off-chain worker computation. This alleviates the need for additional on-chain computational cost, avoiding a corresponding increase to the gas costs associated with matching. Moreover, the GSY Node verification function is able to ascertain whether the bid and offer limitations are satisfied by the matches generated by the GSY Matching Engine (for instance, if the clearing energy rate is lower than or equal to the bid rate and higher than or equal to the offer rate). Therefore, multiple competing GSY Matching Engines can calculate matches for different markets in parallel, each using their own matching algorithm, and afterwards the GSY Node can select and verify the matches that are eligible for clearing, and reject those that are violating their bid and offer requirements. Finally, as the verification function is executed on-chain any potential errors or fraud attempts, such as double counting of trades and matching results, are eliminated. The validation of the actual delivery of the traded energy cannot be performed at this time, due to the fact that the energy is traded ahead-of-time. Another GSY DEX service, the GSY Execution Engine , is tasked with reading the asset measurements of produced or consumed energy, thereby validating whether the energy delivery corresponds to the traded energy. The main functions of the GSY DEX Matching Engine are the following: Order Retrieval: The GSY Matching Engine retrieves orders from the GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage . This storage system holds all active bids and offers, which the GSY Matching Engine reads in order to match suitable counterparts for energy trades. Matching Process: Pursuant to the pay-as-bid strategy, the GSY Matching Engine pairs bids and offers according to price and quantity to maximise value for the exchange participants. Buy orders are organised in a descending order of price, prioritising buyers willing to pay more, while sell orders are arranged in an ascending order, prioritising sellers willing to sell energy at lower prices. This strategy ensures that both parties upon clearance pay or receive the desired price for their energy trade based on their submitted bids and offers. Submission to GSY Node : Once the GSY Matching Engine has identified the optimal matches, it submits these matches to the GSY Node for further processing and execution. This seamless integration with the GSY Node and the GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage allows for efficient energy trading by offloading the GSY Node from the most computationally intensive operations of the matching process. At the same time, the immutability and integrity of the data are not jeopardised, since the GSY Node also participates in the verification process. Lastly, the GSY Execution Engine verifies that the energy trades correspond to the energy delivery. To summarise, the GSY Matching Engine is designed as an autonomous GSY DEX service, applied in conjunction with other services of the decentralised Grid Singularity Exchange, to achieve the following performance optimisation: Enhanced Performance: The matching process is a computationally and memory-intensive operation that requires significant computational resources. By creating a dedicated matching engine, we ensure that the GSY Node can continue to handle other platform functions without being overloaded by the resource-intensive matching process. Gas/Transaction Costs: By creating a dedicated matching engine that interacts with the off-chain storage for the most computationally intensive operations rather than using the GSY Node to execute the entire matching process on-chain, transaction costs are significantly reduced. Scalability: The GSY Matching Engine independent architecture ensures the platform remains responsive and efficient as the volume of market participants and transactions expands without affecting the performance of the GSY Node . Flexibility: As a standalone service, the GSY Matching Engine can be easily updated or modified without impacting other platform components. This allows for the continuous improvement of the order matching process and overall energy trading experience for platform users. Moreover, the GSY Matching Engine enables operation of multiple different matching algorithms in parallel, thus providing the flexibility to use different matching algorithms per market or energy community. This facilitates conformance to local regulation, by not restricting Community Managers to a single matching process, but allowing them to tailor the matching process to their needs. GSY DEX Matching Engine Implementation \u00b6 The GSY DEX Matching Engine is implemented in Rust , in order to take advantage of the ease of interconnection with other components of the GSY DEX, especially with the GSY Node, and the Rust performance benefits compared to other programming languages. The Matching Engine\u2019s operation revolves around a loop that continuously submits requests to the GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage as to whether new open offers or bids have been created. If the Off-Chain Storage reports that new offers and bids have been created, the Matching Engine calls the applicable matching algorithm to calculate the matches and then transmits the calculated matches to the GSY Node. The main Rust modules that comprise the Matching Engine are the Algorithms Module and the Connectors Module. Figure 1 : The GSY DEX Matching Engine Dataflow The GSY DEX Matching Engine Algorithms Module stores the available matching algorithms. Currently the two-sided pay-as-bid algorithm is supported, with additional matching algorithms to be added in the future, either by Grid Singularity or a third party via the GSY DEX Matching API. Furthermore, the design of the Algorithms Module allows multiple algorithms to be deployed in parallel. For instance, different matching algorithms can be applied in different energy communities, or in different buildings within an energy community to optimise their asset configuration The currently applied two-sided pay-as-bid algorithm does not require the offer and bid to fully match each other\u2019s respective energy consumption and production. The algorithm can also conclude a bid-offer match that partially trades the energy required by the bid and/or provided by the offer, with the expectation that the rest of the required or offered energy will be traded at a later time. Subsequently, the residual energy of the bid and/or the offer can be processed by the Matching Engine either in the same list of matches, or in one of the following lists of matches by creating a new offer and bid that will represent the residual energy. The Connectors Module handles the interconnection with the GSY Off-Chain Storage and the GSY Node. The Rust library Subxt (developed by Parity), which is the most common and robust way of interacting with Substrate nodes, is used for the interconnection with the GSY Node. For the interconnection with the GSY Off-Chain Storage, reqwest and tokio are used as an asynchronous HTTP client. The GSY DEX Matching Engine has been customised for the energy market by setting the traded commodity to energy and using kWh for the traded volume and cents/kWh for the trade rate and adapting other relevant parameters. GSY DEX Matching API \u00b6 The GSY DEX Matching API defines the protocol of communication between the Matching Engine and other components of the GSY DEX, following the defined process for the Grid Singularity Engine . The API has two components, one for the inputs required by the Matching Engine to calculate the possible bid-offer matches, and one for transmitting the calculated matches to the GSY Node, in order for energy trades to be generated and trade settlement to be performed. The inputs required by the GSY DEX Matching Engine are the open bids and the offers that are available for a market slot (energy delivery time period). These are retrieved not via the GSY Node, but by leveraging the API of the GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage, thereby minimising the gas cost required for the operation of the Matching Engine, and consequently decreasing the computational effort required from the GSY Node. The bid-offer matches calculated by the Matching Engine are transmitted to the GSY Node via the Trade Settlement Pallet . This GSY Node pallet provides dispatchable functions that can be remotely called, in order to accept the list of bid-offer matches calculated by the Matching Engine, validate them, and subsequently create the energy trades. GSY DEX Matching Engine / GSY Off-Chain Storage Communication \u00b6 To calculate the bid and offer matches, the GSY Matching Engine reads the open offers and bids from the Off-Chain Storage by calling the GET /order REST API endpoint of the Off-Chain Storage . The endpoint will return lists of JSON objects containing all open Bid and Offer structures, which will then be used to generate the BidOfferMatch objects during the order matching process. The JSON format of the output is the following: [ { \"type\" : \"Bid\" , \"buyer\" : <accou nt id o f t he e ner gy buyer who submi tte d t he bid> , \"nonce\" : <u n ique ide nt i f ier o f t he bid , au t oi n creme nte d i nt > , \"bid_component\" : { \"area_uuid\" : <u n ique ide nt i f ier o f t he asse t or marke t area t ha t pos te d t he bid> , \"market_uuid\" : <u n ique ide nt i f ier o f t he marke t t ha t t he bid belo n gs t o> , \"time_slot\" : < t imes ta mp o f t he expec te d e ner gy co nsu mp t io n > , \"creation_time\" : < t ime t ha t t he bid was pos te d t o t he excha n ge> , \"energy\" : <e ner gy i n kWh * scali n g fa c t or , t ha t t he buyer is willi n g t o buy> , \"energy_rate\" : <e ner gy_ra te , i n ce nts /kWh t ha t t he buyer is willi n g t o pay> } }, { \"type\" : \"Offer\" , \"seller\" : <accou nt id o f t he e ner gy seller who submi tte d t he o ffer > , \"Nonce\" : <u n ique ide nt i f ier o f t he o ffer , au t oi n creme nte d i nt > , \"offer_component\" : { \"area_uuid\" : <u n ique ide nt i f ier o f t he asse t or marke t area t ha t pos te d t he o ffer > , \"Market_uuid\" : <u n ique ide nt i f ier o f t he marke t t ha t t he o ffer belo n gs t o> , \"time_slot\" : < t imes ta mp o f t he expec te d e ner gy produc t io n > , \"creation_time\" : < t ime t ha t t he o ffer was pos te d t o t he excha n ge> , \"energy\" : <e ner gy i n kWh * scali n g fa c t or , t ha t t he seller is willi n g t o sell> , \"energy_rate\" : <e ner gy_ra te , i n ce nts /kWh t ha t t he seller is willi n g t o ear n > } } ] Figure 2 : Template of GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage Bid and Offer structures that are read by the GSY DEX Matching Engine GSY DEX Matching Engine / GSY Node Communication - Trade Settlement Pallet \u00b6 The Trade Settlement pallet provides a decentralised trade verification functionality that allows its users to: Verify whether bid-offer matches can result in an energy trade and whether any of the matches violate a mandatory requirement of the bid or offer (e.g. the clearing rate of a match may violate the bid or offer energy rate); Generate the energy trade and perform the financial clearing between the buyer and the seller of energy; and Transmit the trade to the Off-Chain Storage for any further processing (e.g. by the Analytics Engine to generate performance indicators). Moreover, the pallet supports partial offer / bid matching, meaning that the energy from an offer or bid can be used partially and that it is not mandatory that it be used in full. The pallet is able to update the respective bid / offer with the residual energy (energy that remains after the trade was performed) and use the residual energy for matches that are processed at a later time. Communication Overview \u00b6 In order to persist a batch of matches, the GSY Matching Engine calls the settle_trades pallet method, including a vector of BidOfferMatch structures, each representing a single Offer-Bid match. The pallet method then validates these matches and executes the trade. The BidOfferMatch structure is part of the Trades module , and includes the following information: market_id : Unique identifier of the market to which the bid and offer of the match belong time_slot : Time slot of the market to which the Bid and Offer of the match belong. It signifies the time that the delivery of the traded energy should take place bid : The Bid struct that represents the energy demand of the match offer : The Offer struct that represents the energy supply of the match. residual_bid : Optional Bid struct that represents the residual energy that was not traded from the original Bid residual_offer : Optional Offer struct that represents the residual energy that was not traded from the original Offer selected_energy : The traded energy of the match, in kWh. energy_rate : The energy rate of the resulting trade, in cents/kWh. Events \u00b6 TradeCleared : Emitted when a trade is created and cleared Since the Order Book Registry and the Order Book Worker pallets are used by this pallet, all events emitted by them can also be emitted by the Trade Settlement pallet. Errors \u00b6 NotSameLength : Ensure that bid, offer and trade vectors have the same length. NoValidMatchToSettle : Ensure that there are valid matches to settle. OrdersNotExecutable : Ensure that the order\u2019s execution returns an OK(()) value. OrderNotRegistered : Ensure the order has been registered in the Order Book Registry. OfferEnergyRateGreaterThanBidEnergyRate : Ensure that the offered energy rate is lower than the bid energy rate. OfferEnergyLessThanSelectedEnergy : Ensure that the offered energy rate is higher than the selected energy. BidEnergyLessThanSelectedEnergy : Ensure that the bid energy rate is higher than the selected energy. UnableToSubtractEnergy : Ensure that the energy subtraction in the validation is correct. Dispatchable functions \u00b6 settle_trades : Perform trade clearing / settlement for a list / vector of proposed matches. Proposed matches are of the type Vec<BidOfferMatch<T::AccountId>> thus allowing multiple BidOfferMatch objects to be settled at once from the dispatchable function.

The off-chain storage can be accessed by both off-chain workers and on-chain logic. A computational reference (hash) is allocated to each bid and offer to ensure minimal transaction throughput on the blockchain and maximal data privacy for participants in the energy exchange (e.g. members of a local energy community), while providing full transparency and functionality of matching and execution for each trade transacted via the on-chain Order Book (part of GSY DEX Node ). Importantly, final price and energy verification for each trade is performed on-chain. The GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage implementation is grounded in Grid Singularity\u2019s concept of Symbiotic Energy Markets , inspired by mycorrhizal networks. Importantly, while intended for the energy sector, the GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage can also support other industry applications, contributing to both the Energy Web and the wider Polkadot innovation ecosystem. Off-chain workers (also termed mycos in the GSY DEX architecture design) are an integral part of the node (in this case the GSY Node), which execute long-running and possibly non-deterministic tasks, such as encryption, decryption, and signing of data, CPU-intensive computations or enumeration or aggregation of on-chain data (for more see the related Substrate wiki page ). They are automatically created when a blockchain node is deployed, running operations at the end of each block that this node validates. The difference compared to a smart contract or a pallet, is that the off-chain worker has its own runtime, synchronised with the node runtime. Since the code is shared, off-chain workers can immediately access the blockchain, without HTTP or any other protocol. This is a safer and more efficient way to interact with the blockchain compared to Oracles, which is the conventional way of integrating off-chain with on-chain data. Notably, Oracles are not part of the blockchain but an external service that continuously performs actions based on new blocks that the blockchain generates, potentially compromising blockchain security by making it dependent on Oracle security. As a separate service, Oracles also need dedicated scaling if the number of blockchain validators increases which is not the case with off-chain workers. The off-chain storage comprises four distinct components (substorages): GSY DEX Grid Topology Storage : contains information about the physical grid structure, such as the location and configuration of nodes, as well as the interconnections between energy assets, which enable the GSY DEX to both verify the eligibility of the assets for trading, and to facilitate performance analytics that involve the topology of the grid. GSY DEX Measurements Storage : stores the energy consumption and generation data from energy assets. Accurate measurement data is essential for validating and executing energy trades, managing grid stability, and optimising energy consumption and generation patterns. GSY DEX Trades Storage : stores all energy trades of the GSY DEX , which are required in order to maintain and update the trade status to facilitate trade execution, as well as for analytics, auditing the trading behaviour of the user energy assets, and historical market analysis. GSY DEX Order Book Storage : This storage component holds all the orders inserted in the respective market, including bids and offers issued by participants, along with metadata generated for each order. Each of the off-chain storage components is associated with proprietary, component-specific database tables, and exposed to other GSY DEX system components via HTTP REST endpoints to facilitate common operations and streamline access to data. This approach ensures that other GSY DEX system components can read, update and save information related to each storage component. Furthermore, separating the data in different components restricts data dependencies and thereby optimises data management, including by enabling efficient database migration and other operations on the database tables\u2019 schema. Data storage segmentation also facilitates partial data transfer to other data storages in the future system upgrades. Off-chain storage workers\u2019 role is to ensure that off-chain storage subcomponents, namely the GSY DEX Grid Topology Storage and the GSY DEX Measurements Storage, securely receive the required data such as asset-level generation and consumption, and that the GSY DEX Trades Storage and the GSY DEX Order Book Storage can support and improve performance of the matching operation based on a set of preferred energy attributes. Figure 1 : GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage - GSY Node Communication Flow. GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage Communication Protocol \u00b6 The GSY Node stores the order and trade information in the GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage by leveraging off-chain workers as described above, which perform HTTP requests on behalf of the Node. Notably, the GSY Node saves the bids and offers in the GSY DEX Order Book Storage and the trades in the GSY DEX Trades Storage in order to make them available for other system services, namely those performed by the GSY DEX Analytics Engine and the GSY DEX Matching Engine. These other GSY DEX system components all leverage the same HTTP REST API as the GSY Node to access the GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage. The GSY DEX Analytics Engine requires access specifically to the GSY DEX Grid Topology Storage and the GSY DEX Trades Storage to retrieve data to calculate the select performance indicators to monitor individual and aggregate performance of energy assets in the exchange. The GSY DEX Matching Engine, in turn requires access specifically to the GSY DEX Order Book Storage to retrieve the open offers and bids in order to perform the market supply and demand matching operation. Figure 2 : GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage Dataflow. GSY DEX Grid Topology Storage \u00b6 The GSY DEX Grid Topology (Off-Chain) Storage is responsible for persisting the data pertaining to grid topology (also referred to as ontology), which is required for data access management and exchange (energy trade) facilitation. The following data is stored in the GSY DEX Grid Topology (Off-Chain) Storage: Energy asset information, consisting of nameplate parameters for each energy asset participating in the energy exchange, which serve to verify that the values of energy offers and bids submitted by each asset do not surpass the energy values that can be physically consumed or produced by the asset. Attributes assigned to energy generation, consumption and storage assets also serve to define preferences with regards to energy use, technically enabling a wider array of user choices (multi-attribute bids and offers) in markets that facilitate a broader scope of market participation. Grid topology description: defining how the assets are structured and grouped, and providing the location and nameplate parameters of electrical devices that form the electrical grid, namely circuit breakers and voltage transformers. Its main purpose is to form the rules for asset trading (for example, for intra-community trading, only assets from the same community would be permitted to trade). The topology information is also required for the GSY DEX Execution Engine operation, enabling it to verify whether the traded energy is actually produced by the assets, and that the trade can be performed without compromising the resilience and the stability of the grid. GSY DEX Measurements Storage \u00b6 The GSY DEX Measurements Storage is responsible for persisting energy measurements and forecasts for assets defined in GSY DEX Grid Topology in the form of time series data, with predefined time resolution, with default 15-min resolution. The main purpose of energy forecasts is to facilitate and enhance the operation of trading agents, facilitating a more accurate and efficient order submission for the assets that they manage based on improved predictions. Importantly, the GSY DEX will use the asset forecasts to set an upper limit to the sum of the energy of all open orders in the exchange, obliging the exchange participants to not post energy orders which sum to a greater volume than the forecasted energy. Measurements are also required for the GSY DEX Execution Engine operation, in order to verify whether the energy produced or consumed by the energy assets is accurately reflected by the energy trades of these assets, and to assign penalties to assets that sold energy that they did not produce. GSY DEX Trades Storage \u00b6 The GSY DEX Trades Storage is responsible for storing the successful energy trades for all assets that participate in the energy exchange, along with the associated metadata. It streamlines access to the trade information for: Asset aggregators or trading agents that are responsible for managing one or multiple assets, enabling them to reconfigure the asset trading strategy based on historical information relating to the past energy trades for these assets The GSY DEX Analytics Engine, which needs the information related to the energy trades to generate more elaborate analytics to monitor the performance of the exchange overall and the trading assets individually. Payment services, which require access to the energy trades in order to modify the token balances of the seller and the buyer of energy, thereby performing the financial settlement for the energy trades. GSY DEX Order Book Storage \u00b6 The GSY DEX Order Book Storage is responsible for storing all offers and bids posted on the GSY DEX, both open and closed. It should include all information that was posted as part of the bid and the offer, along with metadata that is automatically generated by the GSY DEX. The main purposes for persisting the offers and bids are the following: Report historical offers and bids to all exchange participants, along with all the associated information and the final status (open, traded, deleted); Enable the operation of the GSY DEX Matching Engine by providing a list of open offers and open bids, which represent the energy demand that is currently requested, and the energy supply that is currently offered in the exchange, respectively. GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage Database \u00b6 The GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage Database is the off-chain storage component responsible for persisting the off-chain data required for the correct operation of the GSY DEX. This operation presents a consequential challenge due to the volume of required data points and the requirement to persist and report these data for long periods of time. Furthermore, significant computation will need to be performed on these data, which in turn contribute to the computational effort required by the blockchain nodes for data processing. To circumvent these limitations, these data points are not saved in the blockchain, but in the off-chain database, facilitating storage of data of arbitrary size, and the related performance of more computationally intensive operations. To ensure optimal performance, stability and scalability of the GSY DEX, the off-chain storage database type of choice is MongoDB, a NoSQL document-oriented database, capable of storing and fetching large data volumes. One of its main advantages is horizontal scaling, enabled by sharding , which is a method of distributing data across multiple servers, with each server containing a subset of the data (shard). That way, the total workload capacity of the database is not limited by the resources of a single server. Whenever the server resources become exhausted, a new server can be added to the sharded cluster to extend the total capacity and balance the database load, ensuring efficient computation of increased data volumes. Redundancy and high availability to ensure data security are facilitated by the use of replica sets, which copies part of the data to different database servers, thus providing a level of fault tolerance against the loss of a single database server. GSY DEX Off-Chain Database Schema \u00b6 Each data type required for the operation of the GSY DEX is modelled and structured as a MongoDB Document, both to correctly organise the data and to facilitate and accelerate the expected queries that will be executed on the data. The data types that are persisted in the database for each storage subcomponent are listed below. Grid Topology Storage Database Schema \u00b6 The Grid Topology Storage will store all assets using the same data type, with optional arguments applied to differentiate the asset type and position, creating and persisting a hierarchical layered representation of the electrical grid. Different topology types will support different arguments, accommodating generation, consumption and storage assets (namely PVs, Heat Pumps, Loads and Batteries), as well as electrical devices that form the electrical grid (Smart Metres, Voltage Transformers and Circuit Breakers), along with the Area type that is used in order to group different assets. Topology connections are modelled using the \u201cchildren\u201d argument, which is available only for Area type (also termed Market or Submarket), Voltage Transformer and Circuit Breaker types, and accept a list of asset uuids. { \"type\" : \"Load\" , \"nonce\" : 3 , \"uuid\" : \"load_uuid\" , \"name\" : \"Home 1 Consumption\" , \"community_uuid\" : 13 , \"creation_time\" : 1546300800 , \"max_consumption_kWh\" : 5 , \"coordinates\" : [ 43.2 , 45 ], \"children\" : [] } Figure 3 : Example of GSY DEX Off-Chain Grid Topology Storage Load. { \"type\" : \"VoltageTransformer\" , \"nonce\" : 3 , \"uuid\" : 5 , \"name\" : \"Home 1 Consumption\" , \"community_uuid\" : 13 , \"creation_time\" : 1546300800 , \"max_power_rating_kW\" : 20 , \"coordinates\" : [ 43.2 , 45 ], \"children\" : [ \"load_uuid\" ] } Figure 4 : Example of a voltage transformer in the GSY DEX Off-Chain Grid Topology Storage. Measurements Storage Database Schema \u00b6 The Measurements Storage will persist forecasts and measurements, using the same data type. The type data entry attribute is used to differentiate between forecasts and measurements, thereby allowing the database to select only forecasts or measurements, depending on the user interest. Furthermore, type , asset_uuid and time_slot data entries are indexed, in order to accelerate queries that select forecasts or measurements for a select asset and period of time. { \"type\" : \"Forecast\" , \"nonce\" : 3 , \"asset_uuid\" : 5 , \"community_uuid\" : 13 , \"time_slot\" : 2 , \"creation_time\" : 1546300800 , \"energy_consumption_kWh\" : 1.2 , \"energy_production_kWh\" : 0 , } Figure 5 : Example of a forecast in the GSY DEX Off-Chain Measurements Storage. { \"type\" : \"Measurement\" , \"nonce\" : 2 , \"asset_uuid\" : 1 , \"community_uuid\" : 13 , \"time_slot\" : 2 , \"creation_time\" : 1546300800 , \"energy_consumption_kWh\" : 10.2 , \"energy_production_kWh\" : 0.3 , } Figure 6 : Example of a measurement in the GSY DEX Off-Chain Measurements Storage. Order Book Storage Database Schema \u00b6 Bids and offers are saved using the same data type. Similar to the other storage subcomponents, type data entry attribute in the JSON document is used in order to differentiate between offers and bids, thus allowing the user to filter for either one. Moreover, type , asset_uuid , market_uuid and time_slot data entries are indexed, in order to accelerate queries that select bids or offers for a select asset, market and time slot. { \"type\" : \"Bid\" , \"nonce\" : 2 , \"asset_uuid\" : 1 , \"market_uuid\" : 1 , \"time_slot\" : 2 , \"creation_time\" : 1546300800 , \"bid_component\" : { \"buyer\" : \"aabc\" , \"energy\" : 10 , \"energy_rate\" : 1 } } Figure 7 : Example of a bid in the GSY DEX Off-Chain Order Book Storage. { \"type\" : \"Offer\" , \"nonce\" : 1 , \"asset_uuid\" : 1 , \"market_uuid\" : 1 , \"time_slot\" : 1 , \"creation_time\" : 1546300800 , \"offer_component\" : { \"seller\" : \"bbcd\" , \"energy\" : 10 , \"energy_rate\" : 1 } } Figure 8 : Example of an offer in the GSY DEX Off-Chain Order Book Storage. Trades Storage Database Schema \u00b6 Trades are also saved using JSON documents in a similar format as the Order. The same fields as for the Order Book Storage will need to be indexed, namely asset_uuid, market_uuid and time_slot, thus speeding up the selection of the trades for one asset / market / time slot. { \"type\" : \"Trade\" , \"nonce\" : 2 , \"asset_uuid\" : 1 , \"market_uuid\" : 1 , \"time_slot\" : 2 , \"creation_time\" : 1546300800 , \"energy\" : 10 , \"energy_rate\" : 1 , \"bid_component\" : { \"buyer\" : \"aabc\" , \"energy\" : 10 , \"energy_rate\" : 1 }, \"offer_component\" : { \"seller\" : \"deca\" , \"energy\" : 10 , \"energy_rate\" : 1 }, } Figure 9 : Example of a trade in the GSY DEX Off-Chain Order Book Storage. HTTP REST API Schema \u00b6 Each storage subcomponent is exposed via separate REST endpoints for operations that are most commonly required by the users of the GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage API. GET and POST requests are supported to facilitate reading of database entries, as well as the creation of new database entries. Grid Topology Storage API Schema \u00b6 The Grid Topology Storage uses the dedicated endpoint /grid-topology In order to both fetch and create new entries. The endpoint supports both GET and POST HTTP requests, and the accepted input data format is similar to the database schema: POST /grid - t opology [{ \"type\" : \"VoltageTransformer\" , \"nonce\" : 3 , \"uuid\" : 5 , \"name\" : \"Home 1 Consumption\" , \"community_uuid\" : 13 , \"creation_time\" : 1546300800 , \"max_power_rating_kW\" : 20 , \"children\" : [{ \"type\" : \"Load\" , \"nonce\" : 3 , \"uuid\" : \"load_uuid\" , \"name\" : \"Home 1 Consumption\" , \"creation_time\" : 1546300800 , \"max_consumption_kWh\" : 5 , \"children\" : [] } }] Figure 10 : Example of GSY DEX Off-Chain Grid Topology REST API POST. Measurements Storage API Schema \u00b6 The Measurements Storage uses one dedicated endpoint for forecasts: /forecasts and one for measurements: /measurements Both endpoints support GET and POST HTTP requests, in order to be able to both fetch and create forecasts / measurements. The accepted input data format is similar to the database schema in both cases: POST / f orecas ts { \"type\" : \"Forecast\" , \"nonce\" : 3 , \"asset_uuid\" : 5 , \"community_uuid\" : 13 , \"time_slot\" : 2 , \"creation_time\" : 1546300800 , \"energy\" : 1.2 , } POST /measureme nts { \"type\" : \"Measurement\" , \"nonce\" : 2 , \"asset_uuid\" : 1 , \"community_uuid\" : 13 , \"time_slot\" : 2 , \"creation_time\" : 1546300800 , \"energy\" : 10.2 , } Figure 11 : Example of GSY DEX Off-Chain Measurements Storage REST API POST. Order Book Storage API Schema \u00b6 The Order Book Storage uses the dedicated endpoint /orders In order to both fetch and create new entries. The endpoint supports both GET and POST HTTP request, and the accepted input data format is similar to the database schema: POST /orders/ [{ \"type\" : \"Bid\" , \"nonce\" : 2 , \"asset_uuid\" : 1 , \"market_uuid\" : 1 , \"time_slot\" : 2 , \"creation_time\" : 1546300800 , \"bid_component\" : { \"buyer\" : \"aabc\" , \"energy\" : 10 , \"energy_rate\" : 1 } }] POST /orders/ [{ \"type\" : \"Offer\" , \"nonce\" : 1 , \"asset_uuid\" : 1 , \"market_uuid\" : 1 , \"time_slot\" : 1 , \"creation_time\" : 1546300800 , \"offer_component\" : { \"seller\" : \"bbcd\" , \"energy\" : 10 , \"energy_rate\" : 1 } }] Figure 12 : Example of the GSY DEX Off-Chain Order Book REST API POST. Trades Storage API Schema \u00b6 The Trades Storage uses the dedicated endpoint /trades in order to both fetch and create new entries. The endpoint supports both GET and POST HTTP request, and the accepted input data format is similar to the database schema: POST / tra des [{ \"type\" : \"Trade\" , \"nonce\" : 2 , \"asset_uuid\" : 1 , \"market_uuid\" : 1 , \"time_slot\" : 2 , \"creation_time\" : 1546300800 , \"energy\" : 10 , \"energy_rate\" : 1 , \"bid_component\" : { \"buyer\" : \"aabc\" , \"energy\" : 10 , \"energy_rate\" : 1 }, \"offer_component\" : { \"seller\" : \"deca\" , \"energy\" : 10 , \"energy_rate\" : 1 }, }] Figure 13 : Example of the GSY DEX Off-Chain Trades Storage REST API POST.", "title": "GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage"}, {"location": "blockchain-off-chain-storage/#gsy-dex-off-chain-storage-communication-protocol", "text": "The GSY Node stores the order and trade information in the GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage by leveraging off-chain workers as described above, which perform HTTP requests on behalf of the Node.

These other GSY DEX system components all leverage the same HTTP REST API as the GSY Node to access the GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage. The GSY DEX Analytics Engine requires access specifically to the GSY DEX Grid Topology Storage and the GSY DEX Trades Storage to retrieve data to calculate the select performance indicators to monitor individual and aggregate performance of energy assets in the exchange.

The core of the GSY DEX is built using the Substrate framework, which provides the distributed ledger and custom runtime for implementing the state transition functions required for the energy exchange. Additionally, the system includes a set of ancillary services that enable further scalability and security. GSY Node \u00b6 The Substrate -based GSY Node, responsible for network activities and executing blockchain state transitions, is the backbone of the exchange, consisting of two main parts: Client with external node services: This component handles network activities such as peer discovery, managing transaction requests, reaching consensus with peers, and responding to remote procedure calls ( RPC ). Custom runtime: This component contains all the business logic for executing the state transition functions of the blockchain. The custom runtime is designed to improve scalability and security, avoiding and mitigating multiple blockchain attack types more effectively than by using smart contracts or a generalised virtual machine. For more, please see the section on GSY Node Installation, Operation and Development . Figure 6.2 : GSY DEX On-Chain Operations via GSY Node (Note: Order Book is where bids and offers are stored, to be then matched based on the applicable trading mechanism for price verification and executed based on energy delivery verification). GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage \u00b6 The off-chain storage component of the GSY DEX is designed to store various types of data that are crucial to the platform's operation but do not need to be recorded on the blockchain. This approach enhances scalability and efficiency by reducing the amount of data stored on-chain (importantly, final price and energy verification for each trade is performed on-chain). The off-chain storage comprises four distinct components: GSY DEX Grid Topology Storage: contains information about the physical grid structure, such as the location and configuration of nodes, as well as the interconnections between energy assets, which enable the GSY DEX to both verify the eligibility of the assets for trading, and to facilitate performance analytics that involve the topology of the grid. GSY DEX Measurements Storage: stores the energy consumption and generation data from energy assets. Accurate measurement data is essential for validating and executing energy trades, managing grid stability, and optimising energy consumption and generation patterns. GSY DEX Trades Storage: stores all energy trades of the GSY DEX, which are required in order to maintain and update the trade status to facilitate trade execution, as well as for analytics, auditing the trading behaviour of the user energy assets, and historical market analysis. GSY DEX Order Book Storage: This storage component holds all the orders inserted in the respective market, including bids and offers issued by participants. The Order Book Storage facilitates the efficient operation of the GSY DEX Matching Engine by providing it with the necessary data to match supply to demand according to participants' preferences and market conditions. For more, please see the section on the GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage . GSY DEX Matching Engine \u00b6 The GSY DEX Matching Engine is responsible for identifying suitable matches for energy supply and demand based on participant preferences and market conditions. By efficiently matching bids and offers, the engine facilitates a seamless and optimised exchange clearance. Multi-attribute auctions, which account for participant preferences and applicable market conditions, require more advanced clearing algorithms than single attribute auctions, such as those based on price alone. The optimal approach is to engage off-chain workers to run matching algorithms and then require either the use of trusted execution environments (enclaves) or on-chain verification to determine whether the matching algorithm was correctly executed. To enable this solution, the matching process is decoupled from the settlement verification, and moved to a dedicated component, the Matching Engine. The GSY DEX Matching Engine has been designed to operate as (one or multiple) individual autonomous service(s), responsible for identifying suitable matches for multiple open order books. In order to manage the available GSY Matching Engine services, the GSY Node needs to register each such service and associate it with a user account responsible for operating the respective service. Grid Singularity will facilitate the Matching Engine registration process for the GSY DEX . The GSY DEX Matching Engine reads open bids and offers through the GSY DEX Matching API and submits matches for validation. Since the exchange\u2019s verification function (part of GSY Node ) only checks the validity of each match rather than the result of a specific matching algorithm, there is no longer a need for an agreed matching algorithm, arbitration technique, or redundant off-chain worker computation. For more, please see the section on the GSY DEX Matching Engine . GSY DEX Execution Engine \u00b6 Once a trade has been matched by the GSY DEX Matching Engine , the GSY DEX Execution Engine handles the execution or rejection of the trade by processing energy production and consumption measurements from the energy assets. This component ensures that trades are executed securely, transparently and in accordance with the agreed terms, while maintaining the integrity of the exchange platform. Spot and futures trading requires predictions of energy used at both the asset and network level, often associated with high prediction errors. Thus, although a balancing mechanism addresses the energy imbalances on the physical level, financial exchanges might still not be executed, causing a mismatch between the physical energy delivery and the market accounting. Multiple solutions for mismatch mitigation can be provided by the GSY DEX , to be applied pursuant to respective local regulation: Allow the grid operator to set prices or enforce penalties for any energy mismatch, Implement final gate closure time one day after delivery, allowing post-delivery trading for balance responsible parties to trade imbalances in real-time, and/or Allow post-delivery trading for all market participants. The GSY DEX Execution Engine system component is in development. GSY DEX Analytics Engine \u00b6 The GSY DEX Analytics Engine collects and processes live trading data (bids, offers, trades) and related energy asset information, providing valuable insights and market intelligence to the exchange platform users and / or operators by generating key performance indicators. This information helps users make informed decisions and identify trends, which can lead to more efficient energy trading strategies and improved market dynamics. A list of currently supported key performance indicators can be found here , with more under development. The GSY DEX API Gateway provides REST endpoints in order to facilitate access for authenticated customers to the calculated key performance indicators overview. In addition, the full dataset pertaining to the performance indicators can be downloaded in JSON format for detailed analysis. The GSY DEX Analytics Engine system component is in development. GSY DEX API Gateway \u00b6 The GSY DEX API Gateway serves as a bridge between user and community clients and the GSY DEX . Through this interface, users can access the platform's features, submit energy orders, and retrieve key performance indicators , including the trade volume, as well as current and historical asset data (e.g. energy consumption / production, traded energy). The GSY DEX API Gateway also fosters community engagement and collaboration by allowing third-party developers to build and integrate complementary applications and services, such as payments. Clients of the API Gateway vary from user interfaces (that intend to facilitate exchange access to the user) to automated scripts that execute automated trading scripts to optimise trading behaviour for client-owned assets. The API Gateway will also support different client roles, in order to tailor and manage access for Community Managers, Community Members, Grid Operators, Utilities and other customer types. Secure and privacy-embedded access rights management will be enabled by the Energy Web \u2019s open-source tool for decentralised identity and access management. The objective is for each participating energy asset to have a decentralised identifier (DID) created by the manufacturer and transferred to the owner upon purchase, allowing the participant to trade in the energy market and perform other operations with a verified energy asset. Utilities, grid operators, aggregators, energy community managers and members, as well as other energy market participants can also be validated through this mechanism, facilitating unhindered onboarding and interoperability of many different asset types and participants at varied technology levels. The GSY DEX API Gateway system component is in development.

The GSY DEX is designed to further optimise energy consumption and generation, promote peer-to-peer energy trading, and contribute to a more sustainable and resilient energy infrastructure. The GSY DEX powers Symbiotic Energy Markets , combining multi-attribute double-sided auctions, graph representations of the energy grid and the decentralised computation and verification enabled by blockchain. In the envisaged consumer-centric market design, spot, futures, settlement, and balancing markets are intertwined through the use of time slots, allowing market-driven pricing and accurate accounting of delivered energy. Individuals can optimise for their own multi-attribute objectives (e.g. green energy source, reduced energy bill, preferred trading partner) through Degrees of Freedom in the multi-attribute double auction with dynamic pricing. The grid is represented as a weighted graph, offering grid operators efficient management tools and allowing energy communities to interconnect and trade. The complexity of the matching algorithm is decoupled from the verification of transactions, with matching facilitated by third party matching algorithm providers, termed \u201cmycos\u201d, enabling the exchange itself to operate on a blockchain. New energy market participants are rewarded for providing valuable services such as data and algorithms, while the roles of established market participants (aggregators, grid operators, utilities, and regulators) converge towards the individual and the community. The GSY DEX is built on Substrate , which allows modular business logic to be built directly in the blockchain and facilitates a high and secure transaction throughput. Substrate has components called pallets, where each pallet can represent different functionality, such as smart contracts, storage, auctions, and more. For instance, the GSY Node is built as a storage pallet that provides immutable storage of executed transactions. The GSY DEX, developed and published as part of the Grid Singularity Exchange open-source GPL v.3 licence code base, is currently available for operation in the form of simulated transactions, intended for developers interested in contributing and/or building complementary features. Blockchain code can also optionally be enabled on simulations running locally with the backend code base. Full blockchain deployment will be enabled once the following GSY DEX System Components are completed, with current development in part supported by the European Union FEDECOM project : GSY Node , responsible for network activities and executing blockchain state transitions (custom runtime code in the form of pallets and smart contracts that extend the Substrate runtime and set the framework for GSY DEX services, developed in Substrate/Rust); GSY DEX Off-Chain Storage , which stores various types of data that are crucial to the platform\u2019s operation but do not need to be recorded on the blockchain, thereby enhancing scalability and efficiency (structured in four subcomponents: Grid Topology Storage, Measurements Storage, Trades Storage and Order Book Storage and developed in Substrate/Rust, using MongoDB as database); GSY DEX Matching Engine , responsible for identifying suitable matches for energy supply and demand based on participant preferences and market conditions, facilitating seamless and optimised exchange clearance) developed in Rust with the accompanying GSY DEX Matching API , also developed in Rust; GSY DEX Execution Engine , responsible for execution or rejection of the trade securely, transparently and in accordance with the agreed terms upon the energy delivery verification (in development); GSY DEX Analytics Engine , which collects and processes live trading data (bids, offers, trades) and related energy asset information, providing valuable insights and market intelligence to the exchange platform users and/or operators by generating key performance indicators (in development); GSY DEX API Gateway , which provides an interface that facilitates user access to the platform's features, namely submission of energy orders, and retrieval of key performance indicators , including the trade volume and the current and historical asset data (e.g. energy consumption / production, traded energy). The GSY DEX API Gateway also fosters community engagement and collaboration by allowing third-party developers to build and integrate complementary applications and services, such as payments (in development). The Energy Web Chain is the blockchain of choice for the Grid Singularity Exchange decentralised implementation, anchored upon Polkadot\u2019s scaling solution. Grid Singularity, an energy technology startup, and the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit clean technology organisation, jointly founded the Energy Web Foundation (EWF) in January 2017 as a non-profit entrepreneurial foundation building web3 applications for the energy transition. Having significantly contributed to EWF development and the launch of the Energy Web Chain, Grid Singularity\u2019s role today in the Energy Web is supervisory and advisory via Foundation Council. Figure 6.1 : Decentralised Peer-to-Peer Energy Exchange (GSY DEX) Architecture (Note: GSY DEX system components, designated in green, interact with the GSY Node for on-chain operations via Energy Web Data Hub that provides a secure and interoperable data exchange service. Grid and asset management services are provided through interoperable API interfaces, as are third party services such as billing and payments). The GSY DEX Design Principles The GSY DEX is designed around a set of key principles that guide its development and ensure that it meets the requirements of a modern, efficient, and secure energy trading platform. These design principles are aligned with the use of the Substrate framework for the development of the distributed ledger combined with the definition of a set of complementary ancillary services. Modularity: The GSY DEX is built on a modular structure, enabling each component to be developed, tested, and maintained independently. This modularity simplifies the development process and allows for easy integration of new features, modules, or services in the future. Scalability: The GSY DEX is designed to scale horizontally, accommodating the growing number of participants, transactions, and data. The use of Substrate allows for a highly scalable and efficient distributed ledger, while the ancillary services can also scale independently to handle increased throughput. Interoperability: The GSY DEX promotes the use of open standards, protocols, and APIs to facilitate seamless integration with other systems, platforms, and technologies in the energy sector. This approach enables the GSY DEX to easily interact with other energy management systems, IoT devices, and related infrastructure and applications. Security: Ensuring the security and integrity of the GSY DEX is a top priority. The Substrate framework provides robust security features, including strong cryptographic algorithms and a proven consensus mechanism. In addition, the ancillary services and communication protocols must be designed with security best practices in mind, including encryption, access control, and secure data storage. Decentralisation: The GSY DEX leverages the power of blockchain technology to enable a fully decentralised system. This approach eliminates the need for a central authority, ensuring a transparent, secure, and efficient energy trading platform that is less susceptible to manipulation or control by any single entity. Flexibility: The GSY DEX is designed to be adaptable and capable of incorporating new technologies, innovations, and evolving market requirements. This flexibility is achieved through the use of modular components, extensible APIs, and a development process that encourages innovation and experimentation. Usability: The user experience is an essential aspect of the GSY DEX. The GSY DEX should be easy to use and accessible to a wide range of users, including energy producers, consumers, grid operators, and regulators. The user interfaces and APIs are designed with simplicity, efficiency, and intuitiveness in mind. In brief, while the Grid Singularity Exchange does not require blockchain technology, its decentralised implementation (GSY DEX) enables a more optimal energy market design, deriving a multitude of benefits, directly or by interacting with complementary blockchain-based solutions, including Energy Web\u2019s decentralised identity access management for energy assets and related open-source tools of the Energy Web Digital Spine toolkit , as well as Energy Web Green Proofs , a customisable solution for registering and tracking low-carbon products and their attributes throughout complex supply chains. We rely on open source innovation and ecosystem collaboration to develop an inclusive, efficient, accountable and secure energy exchange.", "title": "GSY DEX Overview"}, {"location": "carbon-footprint-savings/", "text": "Carbon Footprint measures the total emissions of a community by correlating the imported electricity with the average CO\u2082-equivalent emissions of the country of location expressed in kilograms (kg) of CO\u2082 equivalents per kWh. Carbon Savings represent the reduction in carbon footprint resulting from a decrease in electricity imports realised by engaging in community energy trading. The carbon footprint value is calculated as follows: Carbon Footprint (kg CO\u2082-equivalent) = Imported Electricity (kWh) \u00d7 Country\u2019s CO\u2082-equivalent Emissions (kg CO\u2082-equivalent/kWh) / 1000 The carbon savings value is calculated as follows: Carbon Savings (kg CO\u2082-equivalent) = Baseline Carbon Footprint \u2212 Reduced Carbon Footprint Figure 1 : Example of Carbon Footprint and Carbon Savings Results in Grid Singularity\u2019s simulation tool interface (Singularity Map) The two decarbonisation metrics are calculated over a defined time frame (daily or monthly) and exclusively at a community level, considering that the imported electricity composition is not readily available for each community participant but approximated based on country-level electricity consumption emissions as explained above. The emissions data for most European countries is calculated based on real-time values retrieved from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) Transparency Platform API . The platform provides the actual generation per production type on an hourly basis. The carbon intensity for each country is obtained by multiplying the energy generated by every plant each hour by the appropriate electricity supply technology emission factor (EF) from Climate Change 2014: Mitigation of Climate Change . The sum of these products gives the hour\u2019s total CO\u2082-equivalent emissions, and dividing by total electricity generated yields the carbon intensity, based on the following formula: Country Carbon Intensity (kg CO\u2082-equivalent/kWh) = [(Energy Fossil Gas (kWh) \u00d7 EF Gas (kgCO\u2082-equivalent/kWh)) + (Energy Biomass \u00d7 EF Biomass) + \u2026 + (Energy Solar \u00d7 EF Solar)] / (Energy Fossil Gas + \u2026 + Energy Solar) Additionally, two open-source database sources are used for retrieving country-specific CO\u2082-equivalent emission data for other regions, namely Electricity Maps (licenced under the Open Database License (ODbL)), which provides historical data on carbon intensity of electricity generation based on a country\u2019s energy mix, and Our World in Data (licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License - CC-BY), an open-source, nonprofit organisation offering comprehensive global datasets, including carbon intensity of electricity generation. For countries or region****s where direct CO\u2082-equivalent emissions data was not available (such as Andorra, Palau, etc.), values from neighbouring countries or regions are selected. The world carbon footprint value is calculated as follows: World Carbon Footprint (g CO\u2082-equivalent / kWh) = 540 (14.6 (total emissions) / 27000 (global electricity production)) ( source ) A list of CO\u2082-equivalent emission data sources is provided in the table below.

Energy assets, managed by aggregators (companies managing other people\u2019s energy assets and/or energy community managers or researchers acting as aggregators), send their actual energy usage through the Asset API each 15 minutes (or another specified timeframe depending on the determined spot market length) and the exchange operates in real-time to facilitate local energy markets. However, the network does not represent actual energy and financial transactions because the assets\u2019 virtual representations (digital twins) are decoupled in state from their physical (e.g. a battery\u2019s digital twin might have a different state of charge in simulation vs. reality). CTN can be used to assess market performance and investigate different aspects such as tariff models or trading mechanisms and algorithms (see, for example, here ). Connecting and operating a live simulation on Grid Singularity Canary Test Network (GSy CTN) is provided by Grid Singularity as a paid service for those interested to simulate a live peer-to-peer energy trading, and it entails the following activities: A. Preparatory Activities (detailed instructions below) The local energy market (LEM) manager (or researcher acting as LEM manager, later also termed the designated CTN owner) to configure a digital twin of all the local energy market participants and their energy assets via the Grid Singularity web-based simulation tool and run the simulation; Once the simulation is completed, the LEM manager to take steps to request a connection to a live GSy CTN; Grid Singularity team to share a commercial and a data processing agreement with the acting LEM manager to review and execute; Grid Singularity team and the acting LEM manager to conduct a technical workshop to review data and connection requirements and any additional steps to enable data integration; The GSy Admin then reviews and approves the request and initiates the CTN LEM configuration. B. Connecting to Grid Singularity Canary Test Network / Data Integration (detailed instructions below) The GSy Admin to add the acting LEM manager as \u201ca user\u201d of the select LEM CTN simulation (based on provided email address) and assign them the CTN owner role, responsible for trading on behalf of all the participants (assets) in the network; The acting LEM manager to receive a link via email to access the created GSy LEM CTN and log in to view the simulated community under the GSy CTN tab; The next step involves the LEM manager reviewing the configuration and sending a request for live data connection of each asset in their community. GSy Admin will review and approve each connection and the LEM manager will receive an email with all the UUIDs of the community and its assets. Live datastream connection via GSy Asset API for all energy assets in the simulated LEM will be completed by the LEM manager through the CLI terminal using the provided UUIDs of the assets. C. Results Monitoring & Analysis The GSy Admin will monitor the live simulation to ensure that the datastream and derived performance indicators are running without any interruptions. The LEM manager can view the results in real time through the UI. The community manager will also be able to download the results for a deeper analysis. The results will be available for 90 days. Any support of GSy for analysis will be limited to 2 hours. Initiate a Grid Singularity Canary Test Network \u00b6 To initiate a Grid Singularity Canary Test Network (GSy CTN) for a live peer-to-peer trading simulation of a select local energy market, please follow these steps (a video tutorial is also available here ): 1. Configure a digital twin of all the local energy market participants and their energy assets via the Grid Singularity web-based simulation tool and run the simulation, ensuring the relevant data requirements . Once it is completed, click on the Settings tab, and click \u201cGo\u201d in the box that says, \u201cBring your simulation closer to reality\u201d as shown in the image below: Figure 1 : Grid Singularity user interface (Singularity Map) Settings Tab 2. A Grid Singularity representative will be in touch with you shortly to discuss your needs and share a commercial and a data processing agreement to review and execute. As an initial step, you will be required to provide the following information: Your Name Grid Singularity account email address Company name Location of the community Size of the community (number of participants, assets) Energy Supplier / grid operator Purpose of the canary network Simulation name Once your request is defined contractually and approved, your user account will acquire elevated permissions that will allow the creation of a GSy CTN by following the data integration steps defined in the section below. Grid Singularity Canary Test Network Operation \u00b6 Grid Singularity Test Network User Roles \u00b6 With the creation of a Grid Singularity Test Network (GSy CTN), a Registry tab is added to settings in the sidebar to allow for different user role allocation (see image below). Each home/LEM member or asset owner can be assigned to a home digital twin. The grid operator and the aggregator (asset manager) can also be assigned a role as further described below. In case the designated CTN owner does not intend to invite additional CTN users, steps in this section can be skipped. Figure 2 : Grid Singularity User Interface (Singularity Map) Canary Test Network Registry Tab - \u201cSet new user roles\u201d section Each community member or asset owner is invited by the designated CTN owner (acting LEM manager) to participate in the created test network through the Add More People invitation tool. To do this, the CTN owner would assign them a GSy User role and automatically trigger an invitation email to be sent. Upon joining, they would be able to view and analyse results for the assets they own. Figure 3 : Grid Singularity User Interface (Singularity Map) Canary Test Network Registry Tab - \u201cAdd more people\u201d section Aggregators (companies managing other people\u2019s energy assets and/or energy community managers) are invited in the same way. The CTN owner assigns them the Aggregator role and automatically triggers an invitation email. The aggregator then logs in to the platform by following the link in the email and registers their user account, to trade on behalf of each asset assigned to them on the Community Assets tab. Once their registration is accepted by the CTN owner, they can trade on behalf of the assigned assets using the Asset API . Figure 4 : Grid Singularity User Interface (Singularity Map) Canary Test Network Registry Tab - \u201cCommunity Assets\u201d Section The Grid Operator, similar to the Aggregator, must act upon the invitation email instructions (issued by CTN owner by assigning them that role using the \u201cAdd more people\u201d tool), in order to be granted access to manage grid fees and network congestion through the Grid Operator API . Grid Singularity Canary Test Network Data Integration \u00b6 Once the Grid Singularity Canary Test Network is fully configured, the final step is to enable a live data stream from the simulated community\u2019s energy assets to the Grid Singularity Exchange ( Asset API ) by establishing a connection with the hardware\u2019s data service, or directly with the asset smart metres/measurement devices if such a service is unavailable. On the map, the designated GSy CTN owner (acting LEM manager) can click on the relevant LEM participant (home) and the asset to initiate the live data stream input for the Grid Singularity Exchange. In the Advanced Settings tab, the live data switch can be toggled to be enabled or disabled. In case the live data switch is enabled, the selected asset will be configured to accept live forecast / measurement data, sent via the Asset API. If the live data is turned off, data will be read through the uploaded historical profiles instead of reading data sent through the Asset API. The latter is a way to simulate a live test network using historical data for research purposes when a live data connection is unavailable. Figure 5 : Grid Singularity User Interface (Singularity Map) Canary Test Network Advanced Settings Tab Upon completing this step, the energy live asset data will be displayed in the Grid Singularity User Interface as part of the Canary Test Network Results Dashboard, as shown in the image below: Figure 6 : Grid Singularity User Interface (Singularity Map) Canary Test Network Results Dashboard Example Grid Singularity Canary Test Network Data Transmission Options \u00b6 There are two options to connect the community live data stream to the Grid Singularity Exchange. Send live data streams via the Grid Singularity Exchange SDK Grid Singularity Exchange SDK (recommended, compatible with Python-based aggregator or smart metre software). This option is a pure Python library that can be integrated with existing aggregator or smart metre software, automating the process of setting up a data stream from the energy assets to the Grid Singularity Exchange. After installing the library and with minimal configuration (by setting up credentials and asset ids), the aggregator (community manager) can transmit the community assets\u2019 forecasts and measurements. To send live data streams through the Exchange SDK, please follow these steps: Install the SDK Client by following the steps described here .

The degrees of freedom are a key functionality of the Symbiotic Energy Market , a future decentralised market design we aim to enable to the extent that legislation in relevant markets allows people to have more energy choices. The implementation of a decentralised version of the Grid Singularity Exchange (GSy DEX) is described here . A user might be interested to set trading preferences in order to prioritise consumption of green energy (i.e. solar, wind) over grey energy (i.e. coal) or in order to buy or sell energy directly to a friend or family member, for example.The bids and offers for an energy asset include a set of attributes and requirements that reflect its owner\u2019s trading preferences. Attributes are parameters currently supported only for offers, that describe the energy type of the offer posted, which is commonly associated with the energy source (e.g. PV, Wind, Hydro, Biomass, etc\u2026). On the other hand, requirements are parameters associated with both bids and offers, and represent the trading preferences of the users. The currently supported requirements are the following: Offers: Preferred trading partners: community participants the users wish to sell energy to; Bids: Preferred trading partners: community participants the users wish to buy energy from; Energy type: the energy source that the user prefers to consume (e.g. PV, Wind, Hydro, Biomass, etc.) Energy: the maximum amount of energy that the user is willing to consume; Price: the maximum price for energy that the user is willing to pay. Naturally, attributes and requirements can be aggregated/grouped in different combinations to express customised trading preferences. The figure below displays an example of a bid and offer with attributes and requirements. The bid submits three sets of conditions that must be interpreted as OR statements, i.e. each condition must be assessed individually and each requirement of the condition must be fulfilled. In this example, the Consumer desires to buy up to 1.0 kWh from their Mom for a maximum of 28 cents OR up to 1.0 kWh of solar energy for a maximum of 25 cents OR up to 0.5 kWh of energy from any source for a maximum of 20 cents. The Producer has 0.8 kWh of solar energy to sell for no less than 21 cents. In this case, the second condition is fulfilled by the offer, thus the two orders are successfully matched: The energy source (solar) is the same in the bid and the offer; The energy to be traded results in 0.8 kWh; The trading price can range between 21 and 25 cents and will be determined by the matching algorithm in place.

A verification function, integrated into the exchange , confirms that the attributes of the proposed bid and offer match satisfies each other\u2019s respective requirements. The verification function accepts a bid / offer pair as input and, if the requirements are met, a trade is created. Otherwise, the trade is rejected. Multi-attributed bids and offers are submitted through Grid Singularity\u2019s existing Asset API .

The future market design implementation, termed Symbiotic Energy Markets, combines multi-attribute double-sided auctions, graph representations of the energy grid and the decentralised computation and verification enabled by blockchain. In the envisaged consumer-centric market design, spot, futures, settlement, and balancing markets are intertwined through the use of time slots, allowing market-driven pricing and accurate accounting of delivered energy. Individuals can optimise for their own multi-attribute objectives (e.g. green energy source, reduced energy bill, preferred trading partner) through degrees of freedom in the multi-attribute double auction with dynamic pricing. The grid is represented as a weighted graph, offering grid operators efficient management tools and allowing energy communities to interconnect and trade. The complexity of the matching algorithm is decoupled from the verification of transactions, with matching facilitated by third party matching algorithm providers, termed \u201cmatching engines\u201d, enabling the exchange itself to operate on a blockchain. New energy market participants are rewarded for providing valuable services such as data and algorithms, while the roles of established market participants (aggregators, grid operators, utilities, and regulators) converge towards the individual and the community.

Grid Singularity simulates and operates interconnected grid-aware energy marketplaces enabling the utmost degrees of freedom in trading for any market participant. Our co-founders are seasoned energy market professionals and blockchain pioneers, who engaged a talented and diverse team of energy design thinkers and developers, guided by the following principles: Grid Singularity\u2019s mission is to build a sustainable, inclusive and democratic energy market that facilitates the ultimate degrees of freedom for the individual and the energy communities, allowing you to consume, trade or share energy based on your preferences of an energy type, location source, price or trading partner. You are energy. The European Union and other regulators are also supporting a bottom-up, user-centric market design, recognizing its diverse benefits: Grid Singularity facilitates a bottom-up market design by connecting aggregators, which in turn connect households and distributed energy assets digitally represented by trading agents, and grid operators through an application interface ( Grid Operator API and Asset API ). Economic, by incentivising prosumership and local generation and consumption which is cheaper than buying/selling energy directly from the grid while taking into account a wider range of individual preferences; Environmental, optimising the use of green energy supply by fostering collective self-consumption and increased investment in local renewable production; Social, promoting the creation of social energy networks by enabling energy exchange within a community and/or to support local initiatives, advancing community engagement and social inclusion. Modelling simulation studies carried out by Grid Singularity and German and Dutch energy communities and utilities using real-world data have revealed that the activation of local energy markets via Grid Singularity Exchange can increase community self-sufficiency and self-consumption by 7.7% and 5.7%, respectively, and reduce energy bills by around 21% , which could be reinvested in additional storage or other distributed energy assets (DERs). Grid operators can benefit from Grid Singularity Exchange to reduce peak loading and congestion by purchasing grid balancing services and levying flexible grid fees . The initial simulation experiments undertaken by Grid Singularity and German and Dutch energy grid operators revealed 10% reductions in peak loading and congestion, expected to improve with innovation in trading algorithms and grid tariff models.", "title": "Grid Singularity Mission"}, {"location": "duplicating-simulations/", "text": "Any user can duplicate public simulations, in order to run different scenarios and compare or make changes to an existing simulation without losing the original configuration.

Therefore, the Load spends 0.45\u20ac (0.0375+0.075) for 1 kWh of energy coming outside of House 1, with no grid fee added since House 1 has no fees. Finally, the bills of each energy asset is shown : The Load has bought 1 kWh of energy for 0.45\u20ac.

This section will focus on a step-by-step guide to create and simulate LEMs using our software, starting with an explanation and guide for the UI, followed by a more technical tutorial to reproduce in the backend. User-Interface Simulation Configuration \u00b6 When creating a new simulation, simulation collaboration or a simulation in the Canary Test Network, the user needs to define the following general settings: Simulation name : Please provide a unique name. Description : Description of the simulation (optional but encouraged to clarify the intent of the simulation). Project : The user can select a project folder where the simulation is saved. Start date : Simulation start date (please make sure that the date-stamp of any uploaded data coincides with the defined start and end date). End date : Simulation end date. The user can simulate up to 7 days of LEM trading. Solar profile : Sets a template production curve for all photovoltaics (PVs) without custom production curves. Select one the following possible configurations: Sunny (generation profile with 250W panel) Cloudy (generation profile with 250W panel) Partially Cloudy (generation profile with 250W panel) Gaussian (the user can define the panel power output) Upload a profile (a custom default PV production curve can be uploaded as described in Upload File Formats ) Spot market type : The user can select one of three market types: One-sided pay-as-offer , Two-sided pay-as-bid and Two-sided pay-as-clear . Number of spot markets : Number of future spot markets where the energy assets and agents can trade. Duration of market slot : Duration of each spot market,between 2 and 60 minutes. Default is set to 15 minutes. Tick duration : Amount of time between two increments of each market slot when trades are cleared or agent trading rates are updated. Default duration is 15 simulated seconds, yielding 60 ticks per market slot. Grid Fees : The user can select one of two types: Constant grid fee or Percentage grid fee The interface for selecting general settings is shown below: Once the general settings of the simulation are defined, the user can move to the modelling page and set up the grid architecture by adding Markets and Energy Assets. Each market or energy asset is considered as 1 node . At the moment, up to 1000 nodes can be configured. Markets contain a spot market where all connected energy assets, submarkets and parent markets trade energy. Markets can potentially house multiple submarkets of different market types, and this feature will be available in the future version of our software. After adding the first market the user has to select a Market Maker rate. Subsequently, the user can model the simulation by configuring multiple submarkets and energy assets in a hierarchical electrical grid. Once the modelling is completed, the user goes to the Results page to initiate the simulation and view results. Backend Simulation Configuration \u00b6 In the backend, the simulation process is slightly different. There is no need to login to set up a simulation. The user first needs to download the code from our Github Repository (Installation Instructions for Linux , Mac and Windows ). In the setup-file (in Python programming language), general and trading strategy settings can be defined. Examples can be found in the relevant Grid Singularity GitHub folder. This is the most basic skeleton for a setup-file: ``` python from gsy_e.models.area import Area def get_setup ( config ): area = Area ( 'Grid' , []) return area The user can add more nested submarkets recursively by adding more instances of Area to the second parameter (list) of the Area class. If the strategy parameter is set in the Area class, the area is converted to a leaf node, e.g. a load. The following grid architecture is given: Grid House 1 H1 General Load H1 Storage 1 H1 Storage 2 House 2 H2 General Load Bold instances in the outline above are markets ( Area component). For each of these markets, a market agent is created in the background to execute offer/bid forwarding and matching. In the following, the corresponding setup-file is shown. ``` python from gsy_e.models.area import Area from d3a.models.strategy.storage import StorageStrategy from gsy_e.models.strategy.load_hours import LoadHoursStrategy from d3a.models.strategy.pv import PVStrategy def get_setup ( config ): area = Area ( 'Grid' , [ Area ( 'House 1' , [ Area ( 'H1 General Load' , strategy = LoadHoursStrategy ( avg_power_W = 200 , hrs_per_day = 6 , hrs_of_day = list ( range ( 12 , 18 )), final_buying_rate = 35 ) ), Area ( 'H1 Storage1' , strategy = StorageStrategy ( initial_soc = 50 ) ), Area ( 'H1 Storage2' , strategy = StorageStrategy ( initial_soc = 50 ) ), ], grid_fee_pct = 0 , grid_fee_const = 0 , ), Area ( 'House 2' , [ Area ( 'H2 General Load' , strategy = LoadHoursStrategy ( avg_power_W = 200 , hrs_per_day = 4 , hrs_of_day = list ( range ( 12 , 16 )), final_buying_rate = 35 ) ), Area ( 'H2 PV' , strategy = PVStrategy ( panel_count = 4 , initial_selling_rate = 30 , final_selling_rate = 5 ) ), ], grid_fee_pct = 0 , grid_fee_const = 0 , ), ], config = config ) return area Additionally the user has the possibility to change the default general settings in two different ways: Setup file (best option) d3a-setting.json setup-file (best option): \u00b6 For a description of each grid component please see the Modelling section. The user can overwrite the configuration settings by changing variables of the ConstSettings class in the setup-file. This class defines the default values for various parameters (general simulation settings, market settings and energy asset configuration). For instance, the user can define multiple configuration parameters in the get_setup function by overwriting the ConstSettings default values. For example, the following parameters can be set : Market_type (if equal to 1: One-Sided Pay-as-Offer , if equal to 2 : Two-Sided Pay-as-Bid , if equal to 3 : Two-Sided Pay-as-Clear ) Grid_fee_type (if equal to 1: Constant grid fee , if equal to 2 : Percentage grid fee ) Here is an example to setup a simulation with the Two-Sided Pay-as-Bid market type, constant grid fee and default min (0cts/kWh) and max to (35cts/kWh) energy rate for all loads : from gsy_framework.constants_limits import ConstSettings def get_setup ( config ): ConstSettings . MASettings . MARKET_TYPE = 2 ConstSettings . LoadSettings . MIN_ENERGY_RATE = 0 ConstSettings . LoadSettings . MAX_ENERGY_RATE = 35 ConstSettings . MASettings . GRID_FEE_TYPE = 1 d3a-settings.json \u00b6 These general settings can also be parsed via a settings file in JSON format, which contains all constants in the advanced_settings branch. An example can be found here: src/d3a/setup/d3a-settings.json The settings JSON file can be parsed via the --settings-file keyword Setting General Configuration Parameters \u00b6 The following parameters are part of Simulation Config and are initialised before updating any ConstSettings : sim_duration slot_length tick_length cloud_coverage* market_maker_rate* grid_fee_pct* grid_fee_const* pv_user_profile* max_panel_power_W In order to update some of these parameters (starred in list above), please use update_config_parameters method to update the general configuration parameters in the setup file: def get_setup ( config ): config . update_config_parameters ( grid_fee_pct = 5 , grid_fee_const = 35 , cloud_coverage = 2 , pv_user_profile = \"<path>/<profile_name>\" , market_maker_rate = 30 ) area = Area ( 'Grid' , [ Area ( 'General Load' , strategy = LoadHoursStrategy ( avg_power_W = 200 , hrs_per_day = 4 , hrs_of_day = list ( range ( 12 , 16 )), final_buying_rate = 35 ) ), Area ( 'PV' , strategy = PVStrategy ( 4 , 80 ) ), ], config = config ) return area Simulation launch \u00b6 Once the entire grid architecture is modelled, including energy assets, the user can launch the trading simulation by running a command line including desired setup features: -d, --duration: simulated duration of simulation [default: 1d] -t, --tick-length: simulated duration of a tick [default: 1s] -s, --slot-length: simulated duration of a market slot [default: 15m] -c, --cloud-coverage: Cloud coverage, 0 for sunny, 1 for partial coverage, 2 for clouds.

It is their responsibility to ensure a connection for end-users on the distribution network along with energy transport security. Grid operators use grid fees to cover the cost of managing their grid infrastructure. Lately, due to the heightened pace of innovation, increased demand and investment in distributed energy resources (DERs), grid operators face many challenges, such as lines and transformers congestion at specific times of the day. One solution is to use grid fees as a tool to actively manage grid congestion by increasing and reducing the fee during the day, week or year. Increasing the fee at peak transmission and reducing the price during off-peak periods makes it financially attractive for end-users to use flexible energy assets (e.g. batteries, EVs, heat-pumps) to provide demand response services and reduce reliance on the grid. Grid Singularity offers an environment to simulate, test and optimise grid fee incentives for local energy markets (LEMs) At the moment a grid fee can be set as a market fee, namely a fee that is added to each trade that is cleared. The buyer of energy is responsible for paying all the grid fees: bid\u2019s price >= offer\u2019s price + grid fee. Two types of market fees can be implemented: Constant grid fee : constant value in cents/kWh that is added to each trade; Percentage grid fee : percentage value determined by the clearing price that is added to each trade. The following article explains how flexible grid fees may be implemented towards peak reduction. For a video tutorial on how to set grid fees in the Grid Singularity exchange, please follow this link . Constant Grid Fee Calculation \u00b6 The constant grid fee is a market based fee, defined in \u20ac/kWh and added to each trade that is cleared, as shown in the figure below. Figure 3.15 : Constant grid fee calculation in the Grid Singularity Exchange The rate of a bid or offer changes as that bid or offer is propagated into different markets. The offer rate increases to account for the added fees for the relevant market, ensuring that the seller receives a revenue equal or greater than the original offer. The bid rate decreases for the same reason. Figure 3.16 : Constant Grid Fee Example Calculation in One-Sided Pay-as-Offer Market In an One-Sided Pay-as-Offer market , there are no bids, only offers. Offers are propagated throughout the markets in the hierarchy shown in the figure above. Grid fees are accounted for when an offer is forwarded to the higher market, adding that market\u2019s grid fees to any previously accumulated fees. The formula to calculate the new offer rate when placing an offer to a higher market is the following: offer_rate_after_fees (\u20ac/kWh) = offer_rate (\u20ac/kWh) + grid_fee (\u20ac/kWh) If the offer is not purchased after two ticks, it is moved into the next market, with the total rate incremented by the amount of that market's grid fee. In the example above, the PV offer of 0.10 \u20ac/kWh is first placed into the House 2 Market where it gains zero fees. Then it moves into the Neighbourhood 2 Market, gaining a fee of 0.01 \u20ac/kWh to become 0.11 \u20ac/kWh. Then, if not purchased, it moves into the Grid Market , gaining a fee of 0.02 \u20ac/kWh to become 0.13 \u20ac/kWh. Continuing into the Neighbourhood 1 Market, the offer gains a fee of 0.01 \u20ac/kWh to become 0.14 \u20ac/kWh. Continuing into the House 1 Market, the offer gains zero fees. The Load ultimately buys the offer in the House 1 Market at the Clearing Rate of 0.14 \u20ac/kWh. The trade price is calculated by adding the original offer rate ( 0.10 \u20ac/kWh ) and the total fees ( (0.01+0.02+0.01) = 0.04 \u20ac/kWh ), then multiplying by the amount of energy traded ( 1 kWh ) to yield the Trade Price of 0.14\u20ac. The Load pays the Trade Price of 0.14\u20ac, which includes 0.10\u20ac revenue for the PV, 0.01\u20ac fees for the Neighbourhood Market 1, 0.02\u20ac fees for the Grid Market , and 0.01\u20ac fees for the Neighbourhood Market 2. Since the market type is pay-as-offer, the offer rate is used as the clearing rate. The grid fees are added to the offer rate to determine the trade rate and therefore the trade price in each market. The following formula is used: supply_side_fee (\u20ac/kWh) = forwarded_offer_rate (\u20ac/kWh) - original_offer_rate (\u20ac/kWh) trade_rate (\u20ac/kWh) = clearing rate (\u20ac/kWh) trade_price (\u20ac) = energy (kWh) * trade_rate (\u20ac/kWh) For the provided example, the trade price for each market is: Market_trade_price (\u20ac) = (original_offer_rate (\u20ac/kWh) + supply_side_fee (\u20ac/kWh)) * energy (kWh) Grid Market = (0.10 + 0.03)*1 = 0.13, Neighbourhood 2 Market = (0.10 + 0.01)*1 = 0.11, Neighbourhood 1 Market = (0.10 + 0.04)*1 = 0.14, Home 1 Market = (0.10 + 0.04)*1 = 0.14, Home 2 Market = (0.10 + 0)*1 = 0.10. Figure 3.17 : Constant Grid Fee Example Calculation in Two-Sided Pay-as-Bid Market In the Two-Sided Pay-as-Bid market, there are both bids and offers, and both are propagated through the markets in the hierarchy. If a bid or offer is not matched after two ticks, it is moved into the next market. In order to prevent the double accounting of a market's grid fee when a bid and an offer are matched in that market, market fees are added to offers when they enter a new market (target market), and they are subtracted from bids when they leave a market (source market) and enter another one. The formula for propagating the offers is the same as for the one-sided market: offer_rate_after_fees (\u20ac/kWh) = offer_rate (\u20ac/kWh) + grid_fee (\u20ac/kWh) The MarketAgent subtracts the fees from the bid before propagating the bid to the higher market, based on the following formula: bid_rate_after_fees (\u20ac/kWh) = bid_rate (\u20ac/kWh) - grid_fee (\u20ac/kWh) In the case of a Two-Sided Pay-as-Bid market, the offer is moved into the Grid Market by the same mechanism as in the One-Sided Pay-as-Offer market. The bid of 0.30 \u20ac/kWh is placed into the House 1 Market where there are zero fees. If it is not purchased after two ticks, it is moved into the Neighbourhood 1 Market. As explained above, only the fees from the source market are added, which are zero in this case. Hence the bid rate remains 0.30 \u20ac/kWh. Next, the bid is moved into the Grid Market, where its value is reduced by the amount of the fees of its source market, the Neighbourhood 1 Market at 0.01 \u20ac/kWh, resulting in a rate of 0.29 \u20ac/kWh as it enters the Grid Market. In the example above, the bid and offer are matched in the Grid Market. When the offer entered the Grid Market, its rate was immediately updated to account for the Grid Market fees (0.11 + 0.02). The bid was not updated, and if it was not matched in the Grid Market and moved to the Neighbourhood 2 Market, the 0.02 \u20ac/kWh fee from the Grid Market would be subtracted to become (0.29 - 0.02) 0.27 \u20ac/kWh. The fees from the Neighbourhood 2 Market would not be added to the bid unless it entered the House 2 Market (fees added according to the source market). In the Grid Market, the Load bid rate is listed as 0.29 \u20ac/kWh and the PV offer as 0.13 \u20ac/kWh. As the bid\u2019s rate is greater than the offer\u2019s rate, a trade can be scheduled. The trade clears at the bid\u2019s rate, resulting in a Clearing Rate of 0.29 \u20ac/kWh. The Grid Singularity exchange includes an algorithm that calculates the grid fee according to the clearing rate, basing the calculation on the original bid and offer rates. This allows the markets to act more independently and in a decentralised manner, without having to share information regarding their fees with other markets. The algorithm formula is as follows: demand_side_fee (\u20ac/kWh) = original_bid_rate (\u20ac/kWh) - forwarded_bid_rate (\u20ac/kWh) supply_side_fee (\u20ac/kWh) = forwarded_offer_rate (\u20ac/kWh) - original_offer_rate (\u20ac/kWh) For the example, we have the following values: supply_side_fee = 0.13 - 0.10 = 0.03 \u20ac/kWh demand_side_fee = 0.30 - 0.29 = 0.01 \u20ac/kWh After calculating the supply and demand side fee, the trade revenue can be calculated. Note that the original_trade_rate is the amount that the original buyer (in our case the Load) will need to pay, therefore in the Pay-as-Bid market type this is the original bid price. The formula is the following: total_fee (\u20ac/kWh) = supply_side_fee (\u20ac/kWh) + demand_side_fee (\u20ac/kWh) revenue_rate (\u20ac/kWh) = original_trade_rate (\u20ac/kWh) - total_fee (\u20ac/kWh) For the example, the revenue will be: revenue = 0.30 - 0.04 = 0.26 \u20ac/kWh Finally, the trade rate is adapted according to the supply side fee, in order to include the fees of the current market: trade_rate (\u20ac/kWh) = revenue_rate (\u20ac/kWh) + supply_side_fee (\u20ac/kWh) trade_price (\u20ac) = energy (kWh) * trade_rate (\u20ac/kWh) For our example, the trade price for each market is: Market_trade_price (\u20ac) = (revenue_rate (\u20ac/kWh) + supply_side_fee (\u20ac/kWh)) * energy (kWh) Grid Market = (0.26 + 0.03)*1 = 0.29, Neighbourhood 2 Market = (0.26 + 0.01)*1 = 0.27, Neighbourhood 1 Market = (0.26 + 0.04)*1 = 0.30, House 1 Market = (0.26 + 0.04)*1 = 0.30, House 2 Market = (0.26 + 0)*1 = 0.26. The Load pays the Trade Price of 0.30\u20ac, which includes 0.26\u20ac revenue for the PV, 0.01\u20ac fees for Neighbourhood Market 1, 0.02\u20ac fees for the Grid Market, and 0.01\u20ac fees for the Neighbourhood Market 2. Percentage Grid Fee Calculation \u00b6 The percentage grid fee is a market based fee, defined as a ratio (%) of the clearing price that is added to each trade that is cleared, as shown in the figure below. Figure 3.18 : Percentage grid fee calculation in the Grid Singularity Exchange The price of a bid or offer changes as it is propagated into different markets to account for market fees. This way, a trading agent posting an offer will never receive less than offered and an agent making a bid will never pay more than bid. Figure 3.19 : Percentage Grid Fee Example Calculation in One-Sided Pay-as-Offer Market In the One-Sided Pay-as-Offer market, there are no bids, only offers. The offers are propagated throughout the markets in the hierarchy. The grid fees are taken into account when an offer is forwarded to the higher market, by the higher market itself. Therefore the agent is not responsible for adapting the offer price to include the grid fees. The grid fees' unit is a ratio of the original offer price, therefore the formula to calculate the new offer price when placing an offer to a market is the following: offer_price_after_fees = offer_price + original_offer_price * grid_fee_ratio If the offer is not purchased after two ticks , it is moved into the next market, where the price is increased by that market\u2019s grid fee. In the provided example, the PV offer of 0.10\u20ac is first placed in the House 2 Market where it gains zero fees. Then it propagates into the Neighbourhood 2 Market, gaining the market\u2019s fee of 5% of the original offer price 0.10*0.05+0.10=0.105\u20ac . If unmatched, it propagates into the Grid Market , with an additional 10% fee of the original offer is applied: 0.10*0.10+0.105=0.115\u20ac . Continuing into the Neighbourhood 1 Market, the offer gains another fee of 5% of the original price 0.10*0.05+0.115=0.12\u20ac . Continuing into the House 1 Market, the offer gains zero additional fees as there is no fee in that market. The Load buys the offer in the House 1 Market at the Clearing Price of 0.12\u20ac. Starting with the initial offer price, the total fees are calculated 0.10*(1+0.05+0.10+0.05)=0.02 to yield the Trade Price of 0.12\u20ac. The Load pays the Trade Price of 0.12\u20ac, which includes 0.10\u20ac revenue for the PV, 0.005\u20ac fees for the Neighbourhood Market 1, 0.01\u20ac fees for the Grid Market, and 0.005\u20ac fees for the Neighbourhood Market 2. Since the market type is pay-as-offer, the offer rates are used as \u2018clearing\u2019 rates. The trade price is then calculated by multiplying the clearing rate with the energy volume. For each market trade, the market grid fee is calculated based on the original offer rate and it is subtracted from the trade_price, in order to calculate the trade price after fees (and thus the revenue for the seller). The following formula is used: market_fees = grid_fee_ratio * original_rate * energy_portion trade_price_after_fees = energy * trade_rate - market_fees trade_price = energy * trade_rate Figure 3.20 : Percentage Grid Fee Example Calculation in Two-Sided Pay-as-Bid Market In the Two-Sided Pay-as-Bid market , both bids and offers are propagated through the markets in the hierarchy. If a bid or offer is not purchased after two ticks , it propagates into the next market. In order to prevent double accounting of a market's grid fee when a bid and an offer are matched in that market, market fees are added to offers when they enter that market (target market) and subtracted from bids when they leave that market and enter another (source market). The formula for propagating the offers is the same as for the one-sided market: offer_price_after_fees = offer_price + original_price * grid_fee_ratio The Market Agent (MA) subtracts the fees from the bid before propagating it to a higher market. The formula for an area to update the bid to include grid fees is the following: bid_price_after_fees = bid_price - original_price * grid_fee_ratio In the case of the Two-Sided Pay-as-Bid market, the offer has moved into the Grid Market by the same mechanism as for the One-Sided Pay-as-Offer market. The bid of 0.30\u20ac follows a similar mechanism and is placed into the House 1 Market where there are zero fees. If the bid is not purchased after two ticks, it is moved into the Neighborhood 1 Market. As explained above, only the fees from the source market are added, which are zero in this case. Hence the bid remains at 0.30\u20ac. Next, the bid is moved to the Grid Market, and incurs the fees of the source market, the Neighborhood 1 Market of 5% to 0.30-0.30*0.05=0.285\u20ac . In the example above, the bid and offer are matched in the Grid Market. When the offer entered the Grid Market, its price was immediately updated to account for the Grid Market's fees 0.10*0.10+0.105=0.115\u20ac . The bid, however, did not add the 10% fee as only the fees from the source markets are added. In the case that the bid was not matched in the Grid Market and moved into the Neighborhood 2 Market, the 10% fee from the Grid Market would be added to the bid. In this case, the bid would become 0.285-0.30*0.10=0.255\u20ac . In the Grid Market, the Load bid is listed as 0.285\u20ac and the PV offer is listed as 0.115\u20ac. As the bid rate is greater than the offer rate, a trade can be scheduled. The trade clears at the bid rate, resulting in a Clearing Price of 0.285\u20ac. The algorithm to calculate the final grid fees for each trade is decentralised, allowing the markets to act more independently without having to share information regarding their fees with other markets. In order to calculate the fee correctly based on the original price, the algorithm needs to be able to calculate the supply side and demand side fee. It is easily calculated using the most recent forwarded rate and the original bid or offer rate: demand_side_fee = 1 - (forwarded_bid_rate / original_bid_rate) supply_side_fee = (forwarded_offer_rate / original_offer_rate) - 1 The provided example has the following values: supply_side_fee=(0.115/0.1)-1=0.15 demand_side_fee=1-(0.285/0.3)=0.05 After calculating the supply and the demand side fee, the trade revenue can be determined. Note the original_trade_rate is the amount that the original buyer (in our case the Load) will need to pay, and therefore the original bid price in a Pay-as-Bid market. The formula is the following: total_fee_ratio = supply_side_fee + demand_side_fee revenue = original_trade_rate / (1 + total_fee_ratio) In the provided example, revenue = 0.30/(1+0.15+0.05)=0.25 The grid fees are then calculated based on the revenue and the individual market fees: fees = revenue * grid_fee_ratio For the Grid Market in the provided example, the fees are 0.25*0.1=0.025 , and for each Neighborhood market, the fees are 0.25*0.05=0.0125 . Finally, the trade rate is adapted according to include the supply side grid fee, in order to include the fees of the current market: trade_rate = revenue * (1 + supply_side_fee) trade_price = energy * trade_rate In the provided example, the trade price for each market is: Grid Market = 0.25 * (1 + 0.15) = 0.2875 Neighborhood 2 Market = 0.25 * (1 + 0.05) = 0.2625 Neighborhood 1 Market = 0.25 * (1 + 0.2) = 0.3 House 1 Market = 0.25 * (1 + 0.2) = 0.3 House 2 Market = 0.25 * (1 + 0) = 0.25 The Load pays the Trade Price of 0.30\u20ac, which includes 0.25\u20ac revenue for the PV, 0.0125\u20ac fees for the Neighborhood Market 1, 0.025\u20ac fees for the Grid Market, and 0.0125\u20ac fees for the Neighborhood Market 2.", "title": "Grid Fee Accounting"}, {"location": "grid-fee-accounting/#grid-fee-objectives", "text": "Grid operators (Distribution and Transmission System Operators - DSOs and TSOs - or Independent System Operators - ISOs in the USA) are tasked to monitor and manage the electrical grid. It is their responsibility to ensure a connection for end-users on the distribution network along with energy transport security. Grid operators use grid fees to cover the cost of managing their grid infrastructure. Lately, due to the heightened pace of innovation, increased demand and investment in distributed energy resources (DERs), grid operators face many challenges, such as lines and transformers congestion at specific times of the day. One solution is to use grid fees as a tool to actively manage grid congestion by increasing and reducing the fee during the day, week or year. Increasing the fee at peak transmission and reducing the price during off-peak periods makes it financially attractive for end-users to use flexible energy assets (e.g. batteries, EVs, heat-pumps) to provide demand response services and reduce reliance on the grid. Grid Singularity offers an environment to simulate, test and optimise grid fee incentives for local energy markets (LEMs) At the moment a grid fee can be set as a market fee, namely a fee that is added to each trade that is cleared. The buyer of energy is responsible for paying all the grid fees: bid\u2019s price >= offer\u2019s price + grid fee. Two types of market fees can be implemented: Constant grid fee : constant value in cents/kWh that is added to each trade; Percentage grid fee : percentage value determined by the clearing price that is added to each trade. The following article explains how flexible grid fees may be implemented towards peak reduction.

Figure 3.15 : Constant grid fee calculation in the Grid Singularity Exchange The rate of a bid or offer changes as that bid or offer is propagated into different markets. The offer rate increases to account for the added fees for the relevant market, ensuring that the seller receives a revenue equal or greater than the original offer. The bid rate decreases for the same reason. Figure 3.16 : Constant Grid Fee Example Calculation in One-Sided Pay-as-Offer Market In an One-Sided Pay-as-Offer market , there are no bids, only offers. Offers are propagated throughout the markets in the hierarchy shown in the figure above. Grid fees are accounted for when an offer is forwarded to the higher market, adding that market\u2019s grid fees to any previously accumulated fees. The formula to calculate the new offer rate when placing an offer to a higher market is the following: offer_rate_after_fees (\u20ac/kWh) = offer_rate (\u20ac/kWh) + grid_fee (\u20ac/kWh) If the offer is not purchased after two ticks, it is moved into the next market, with the total rate incremented by the amount of that market's grid fee. In the example above, the PV offer of 0.10 \u20ac/kWh is first placed into the House 2 Market where it gains zero fees. Then it moves into the Neighbourhood 2 Market, gaining a fee of 0.01 \u20ac/kWh to become 0.11 \u20ac/kWh. Then, if not purchased, it moves into the Grid Market , gaining a fee of 0.02 \u20ac/kWh to become 0.13 \u20ac/kWh. Continuing into the Neighbourhood 1 Market, the offer gains a fee of 0.01 \u20ac/kWh to become 0.14 \u20ac/kWh. Continuing into the House 1 Market, the offer gains zero fees. The Load ultimately buys the offer in the House 1 Market at the Clearing Rate of 0.14 \u20ac/kWh. The trade price is calculated by adding the original offer rate ( 0.10 \u20ac/kWh ) and the total fees ( (0.01+0.02+0.01) = 0.04 \u20ac/kWh ), then multiplying by the amount of energy traded ( 1 kWh ) to yield the Trade Price of 0.14\u20ac. The Load pays the Trade Price of 0.14\u20ac, which includes 0.10\u20ac revenue for the PV, 0.01\u20ac fees for the Neighbourhood Market 1, 0.02\u20ac fees for the Grid Market , and 0.01\u20ac fees for the Neighbourhood Market 2. Since the market type is pay-as-offer, the offer rate is used as the clearing rate. The grid fees are added to the offer rate to determine the trade rate and therefore the trade price in each market. The following formula is used: supply_side_fee (\u20ac/kWh) = forwarded_offer_rate (\u20ac/kWh) - original_offer_rate (\u20ac/kWh) trade_rate (\u20ac/kWh) = clearing rate (\u20ac/kWh) trade_price (\u20ac) = energy (kWh) * trade_rate (\u20ac/kWh) For the provided example, the trade price for each market is: Market_trade_price (\u20ac) = (original_offer_rate (\u20ac/kWh) + supply_side_fee (\u20ac/kWh)) * energy (kWh) Grid Market = (0.10 + 0.03)*1 = 0.13, Neighbourhood 2 Market = (0.10 + 0.01)*1 = 0.11, Neighbourhood 1 Market = (0.10 + 0.04)*1 = 0.14, Home 1 Market = (0.10 + 0.04)*1 = 0.14, Home 2 Market = (0.10 + 0)*1 = 0.10. Figure 3.17 : Constant Grid Fee Example Calculation in Two-Sided Pay-as-Bid Market In the Two-Sided Pay-as-Bid market, there are both bids and offers, and both are propagated through the markets in the hierarchy. If a bid or offer is not matched after two ticks, it is moved into the next market. In order to prevent the double accounting of a market's grid fee when a bid and an offer are matched in that market, market fees are added to offers when they enter a new market (target market), and they are subtracted from bids when they leave a market (source market) and enter another one. The formula for propagating the offers is the same as for the one-sided market: offer_rate_after_fees (\u20ac/kWh) = offer_rate (\u20ac/kWh) + grid_fee (\u20ac/kWh) The MarketAgent subtracts the fees from the bid before propagating the bid to the higher market, based on the following formula: bid_rate_after_fees (\u20ac/kWh) = bid_rate (\u20ac/kWh) - grid_fee (\u20ac/kWh) In the case of a Two-Sided Pay-as-Bid market, the offer is moved into the Grid Market by the same mechanism as in the One-Sided Pay-as-Offer market. The bid of 0.30 \u20ac/kWh is placed into the House 1 Market where there are zero fees. If it is not purchased after two ticks, it is moved into the Neighbourhood 1 Market. As explained above, only the fees from the source market are added, which are zero in this case. Hence the bid rate remains 0.30 \u20ac/kWh. Next, the bid is moved into the Grid Market, where its value is reduced by the amount of the fees of its source market, the Neighbourhood 1 Market at 0.01 \u20ac/kWh, resulting in a rate of 0.29 \u20ac/kWh as it enters the Grid Market. In the example above, the bid and offer are matched in the Grid Market. When the offer entered the Grid Market, its rate was immediately updated to account for the Grid Market fees (0.11 + 0.02). The bid was not updated, and if it was not matched in the Grid Market and moved to the Neighbourhood 2 Market, the 0.02 \u20ac/kWh fee from the Grid Market would be subtracted to become (0.29 - 0.02) 0.27 \u20ac/kWh. The fees from the Neighbourhood 2 Market would not be added to the bid unless it entered the House 2 Market (fees added according to the source market). In the Grid Market, the Load bid rate is listed as 0.29 \u20ac/kWh and the PV offer as 0.13 \u20ac/kWh. As the bid\u2019s rate is greater than the offer\u2019s rate, a trade can be scheduled. The trade clears at the bid\u2019s rate, resulting in a Clearing Rate of 0.29 \u20ac/kWh. The Grid Singularity exchange includes an algorithm that calculates the grid fee according to the clearing rate, basing the calculation on the original bid and offer rates. This allows the markets to act more independently and in a decentralised manner, without having to share information regarding their fees with other markets. The algorithm formula is as follows: demand_side_fee (\u20ac/kWh) = original_bid_rate (\u20ac/kWh) - forwarded_bid_rate (\u20ac/kWh) supply_side_fee (\u20ac/kWh) = forwarded_offer_rate (\u20ac/kWh) - original_offer_rate (\u20ac/kWh) For the example, we have the following values: supply_side_fee = 0.13 - 0.10 = 0.03 \u20ac/kWh demand_side_fee = 0.30 - 0.29 = 0.01 \u20ac/kWh After calculating the supply and demand side fee, the trade revenue can be calculated. Note that the original_trade_rate is the amount that the original buyer (in our case the Load) will need to pay, therefore in the Pay-as-Bid market type this is the original bid price. The formula is the following: total_fee (\u20ac/kWh) = supply_side_fee (\u20ac/kWh) + demand_side_fee (\u20ac/kWh) revenue_rate (\u20ac/kWh) = original_trade_rate (\u20ac/kWh) - total_fee (\u20ac/kWh) For the example, the revenue will be: revenue = 0.30 - 0.04 = 0.26 \u20ac/kWh Finally, the trade rate is adapted according to the supply side fee, in order to include the fees of the current market: trade_rate (\u20ac/kWh) = revenue_rate (\u20ac/kWh) + supply_side_fee (\u20ac/kWh) trade_price (\u20ac) = energy (kWh) * trade_rate (\u20ac/kWh) For our example, the trade price for each market is: Market_trade_price (\u20ac) = (revenue_rate (\u20ac/kWh) + supply_side_fee (\u20ac/kWh)) * energy (kWh) Grid Market = (0.26 + 0.03)*1 = 0.29, Neighbourhood 2 Market = (0.26 + 0.01)*1 = 0.27, Neighbourhood 1 Market = (0.26 + 0.04)*1 = 0.30, House 1 Market = (0.26 + 0.04)*1 = 0.30, House 2 Market = (0.26 + 0)*1 = 0.26. The Load pays the Trade Price of 0.30\u20ac, which includes 0.26\u20ac revenue for the PV, 0.01\u20ac fees for Neighbourhood Market 1, 0.02\u20ac fees for the Grid Market, and 0.01\u20ac fees for the Neighbourhood Market 2.", "title": "Constant Grid Fee Calculation"}, {"location": "grid-fee-accounting/#percentage-grid-fee-calculation", "text": "The percentage grid fee is a market based fee, defined as a ratio (%) of the clearing price that is added to each trade that is cleared, as shown in the figure below. Figure 3.18 : Percentage grid fee calculation in the Grid Singularity Exchange The price of a bid or offer changes as it is propagated into different markets to account for market fees. This way, a trading agent posting an offer will never receive less than offered and an agent making a bid will never pay more than bid. Figure 3.19 : Percentage Grid Fee Example Calculation in One-Sided Pay-as-Offer Market In the One-Sided Pay-as-Offer market, there are no bids, only offers. The offers are propagated throughout the markets in the hierarchy. The grid fees are taken into account when an offer is forwarded to the higher market, by the higher market itself. Therefore the agent is not responsible for adapting the offer price to include the grid fees. The grid fees' unit is a ratio of the original offer price, therefore the formula to calculate the new offer price when placing an offer to a market is the following: offer_price_after_fees = offer_price + original_offer_price * grid_fee_ratio If the offer is not purchased after two ticks , it is moved into the next market, where the price is increased by that market\u2019s grid fee. In the provided example, the PV offer of 0.10\u20ac is first placed in the House 2 Market where it gains zero fees. Then it propagates into the Neighbourhood 2 Market, gaining the market\u2019s fee of 5% of the original offer price 0.10*0.05+0.10=0.105\u20ac . If unmatched, it propagates into the Grid Market , with an additional 10% fee of the original offer is applied: 0.10*0.10+0.105=0.115\u20ac . Continuing into the Neighbourhood 1 Market, the offer gains another fee of 5% of the original price 0.10*0.05+0.115=0.12\u20ac . Continuing into the House 1 Market, the offer gains zero additional fees as there is no fee in that market. The Load buys the offer in the House 1 Market at the Clearing Price of 0.12\u20ac. Starting with the initial offer price, the total fees are calculated 0.10*(1+0.05+0.10+0.05)=0.02 to yield the Trade Price of 0.12\u20ac. The Load pays the Trade Price of 0.12\u20ac, which includes 0.10\u20ac revenue for the PV, 0.005\u20ac fees for the Neighbourhood Market 1, 0.01\u20ac fees for the Grid Market, and 0.005\u20ac fees for the Neighbourhood Market 2. Since the market type is pay-as-offer, the offer rates are used as \u2018clearing\u2019 rates. The trade price is then calculated by multiplying the clearing rate with the energy volume. For each market trade, the market grid fee is calculated based on the original offer rate and it is subtracted from the trade_price, in order to calculate the trade price after fees (and thus the revenue for the seller). The following formula is used: market_fees = grid_fee_ratio * original_rate * energy_portion trade_price_after_fees = energy * trade_rate - market_fees trade_price = energy * trade_rate Figure 3.20 : Percentage Grid Fee Example Calculation in Two-Sided Pay-as-Bid Market In the Two-Sided Pay-as-Bid market , both bids and offers are propagated through the markets in the hierarchy. If a bid or offer is not purchased after two ticks , it propagates into the next market. In order to prevent double accounting of a market's grid fee when a bid and an offer are matched in that market, market fees are added to offers when they enter that market (target market) and subtracted from bids when they leave that market and enter another (source market). The formula for propagating the offers is the same as for the one-sided market: offer_price_after_fees = offer_price + original_price * grid_fee_ratio The Market Agent (MA) subtracts the fees from the bid before propagating it to a higher market. The formula for an area to update the bid to include grid fees is the following: bid_price_after_fees = bid_price - original_price * grid_fee_ratio In the case of the Two-Sided Pay-as-Bid market, the offer has moved into the Grid Market by the same mechanism as for the One-Sided Pay-as-Offer market. The bid of 0.30\u20ac follows a similar mechanism and is placed into the House 1 Market where there are zero fees. If the bid is not purchased after two ticks, it is moved into the Neighborhood 1 Market. As explained above, only the fees from the source market are added, which are zero in this case. Hence the bid remains at 0.30\u20ac. Next, the bid is moved to the Grid Market, and incurs the fees of the source market, the Neighborhood 1 Market of 5% to 0.30-0.30*0.05=0.285\u20ac . In the example above, the bid and offer are matched in the Grid Market. When the offer entered the Grid Market, its price was immediately updated to account for the Grid Market's fees 0.10*0.10+0.105=0.115\u20ac . The bid, however, did not add the 10% fee as only the fees from the source markets are added. In the case that the bid was not matched in the Grid Market and moved into the Neighborhood 2 Market, the 10% fee from the Grid Market would be added to the bid. In this case, the bid would become 0.285-0.30*0.10=0.255\u20ac . In the Grid Market, the Load bid is listed as 0.285\u20ac and the PV offer is listed as 0.115\u20ac.

A LEM can contain submarkets, such as a home market where a solar panel is supplying a fridge and a battery, and the battery is supplying a television, etc. Markets follow a hierarchical structure and are interconnected, allowing bids and offers to pass between markets until they are matched, following a select market clearing mechanism and accounting for network costs.

In this section, each script will be described along with its functionalities in order of complexity. Implement basic grid fees \u00b6 A template file for managing the market fees through the gsy-e-sdk API client is available here . The script illustrates the most basic implementation of a Grid Operator API strategy: setting grid fees for different markets in the Grid Singularity Exchange. Initially, the user needs to list the markets to be managed via the API. For simulations launched via the user-interface (UI), the CONNECT_TO_ALL_ASSETS parameter is available. If this parameter is set to True, the Grid Operator API connects automatically to all the markets for which the user is registered . # List of markets' names to be connected with the API MARKET_NAMES = [ \"Grid\" , \"Community\" , ] ORACLE_NAME = \"dso\" SLOT_LENGTH = 15 # leave as is CONNECT_TO_ALL_MARKETS = True At the beginning of each market slot , the script loops through the markets configured in the simulation. For each market, it reads the market fee for the current time slot and sets it for the next. That information is logged in the terminal in a table format. def on_market_cycle ( self , market_info ): current_market_fee = {} for area_uuid , area_dict in self . latest_grid_tree_flat . items (): if area_dict [ \"area_name\" ] in MARKET_NAMES : self . add_to_batch_commands . last_market_dso_stats ( area_uuid ) current_market_fee [ area_dict [ \"area_name\" ]] = area_dict [ \"current_market_fee\" ] next_market_fee = self . _set_new_market_fee () log_grid_fees_information ( MARKET_NAMES , current_market_fee , next_market_fee ) Since there is no preconfigured pricing strategy in this script, the market fee is hardcoded in the set_new_market_fee function (in this example, it was assigned a value of 10). Then, the batch commands are executed. def _set_new_market_fee ( self ): \"\"\"Return the market fees for each market for the next time slot.\"\"\" next_market_fee = {} for area_uuid , area_dict in self . latest_grid_tree_flat . items (): if area_dict [ \"area_name\" ] in MARKET_NAMES : next_market_fee [ area_dict [ \"area_name\" ]] = 10 self . add_to_batch_commands . grid_fees ( area_uuid = area_uuid , fee_cents_kwh = next_market_fee [ area_dict [ \"area_name\" ]], ) self . execute_batch_commands () return next_market_fee Later in the script, the on_event_or_response is called. By default, the Asset API template does not perform any operation here but the user can add events . For instance, the user could record all the trades occurring in that event. Lastly, the script overwrites the on_finish event so that the script stops whenever the function is triggered. If the user wishes to save any information reported in the logs, it can be done by exporting it to an external file. def on_event_or_response ( self , message ): pass def on_finish ( self , finish_info ): self . is_finished = True The rest of the script is used to connect to the energy assets of a running simulation/collaboration/Canary Test Network. These lines should work as is and no changes are required. market_args = { \"simulation_id\" : os . environ [ \"API_CLIENT_SIMULATION_ID\" ], \"domain_name\" : os . environ [ \"API_CLIENT_DOMAIN_NAME\" ], \"websockets_domain_name\" : os . environ [ \"API_CLIENT_WEBSOCKET_DOMAIN_NAME\" ], } aggregator = Oracle ( aggregator_name = ORACLE_NAME , ** market_args ) if CONNECT_TO_ALL_MARKETS : registry = aggregator . get_configuration_registry () MARKET_NAMES = get_assets_name ( registry )[ \"Area\" ] print () print ( \"Connecting to markets ...\" ) for i in MARKET_NAMES : market_uuid = get_area_uuid_from_area_name_and_collaboration_id ( market_args [ \"simulation_id\" ], i , market_args [ \"domain_name\" ] ) market_args [ \"area_id\" ] = market_uuid market_registered = RestMarketClient ( ** market_args ) market_registered . select_aggregator ( aggregator . aggregator_uuid ) print ( \"----> Connected to \" , i ) print ( aggregator . device_uuid_list ) # loop to allow persistence while not aggregator . is_finished : sleep ( 0.5 ) For simulations ran in the backend, a similar script is available here . Implement dynamic grid fees with Time of Use strategy \u00b6 In Time of Use (ToU) strategy, grid fees are applied depending on the time of the day (hours and minutes) regardless of the market conditions. After analyzing import and export patterns of their client, grid operators can create a time-based curve, increasing fees at peak predicted times (e.g. morning and dinner time). Below is an example of a ToU strategy used by the grid operators in one of the experiments at Odyssey hackathon . A template script can be found here . The ToU strategy is uploaded to the Grid Operator API script as a CSV file (an example can be found here ), with the following structure: As shown in the table above, for each market (in this case, the Community market and the Grid market), a value in ct\u20ac/kWh is assigned with a granularity of 15 min. The file is loaded through the read_fee_strategy function: def read_fee_strategy (): \"Return a dictionary containing the Time of Use strategy loaded from the CSV input file.\" with open ( os . path . join ( module_dir , \"resources/ToU.csv\" ), newline = \"\" , encoding = \"utf-8\" ) as csvfile : csv_rows = csv . reader ( csvfile , delimiter = \" \" , quotechar = \"|\" ) headers = next ( csv_rows )[ 0 ] . split ( \";\" ) market_indexes = {} planned_fee = {} for market_name in MARKET_NAMES : market_indexes . update ({( market_name , headers . index ( market_name ))}) for row in csv_rows : row = row [ 0 ] . split ( \";\" ) for market in MARKET_NAMES : planned_fee . update ({( row [ 0 ], market ): row [ market_indexes [ market ]]}) return planned_fee As explained in the previous section, here the script sets the market fee for each market for the next time slot and prints that information in the terminal. Note that in this case, the value is taken from the uploaded CSV file instead of being hardcoded (inserted in the code). The calculate_next_slot_market_fee function reads the scheduled fees from the spreadsheet and returns the corresponding grid fee value according to each market and the current market slot. def calculate_next_slot_market_fee ( market_time : DateTime , market_name : str ) -> float : \"\"\"Return the market fee for the next time slot.\"\"\" slot_time = market_time . add ( minutes = SLOT_LENGTH ) . format ( TIME_FORMAT_SECONDS ) if ( slot_time , market_name ) in fee_strategy : next_fee = fee_strategy [( slot_time , market_name )] if not isinstance ( next_fee , ( int , float )): next_fee = float ( next_fee . replace ( \",\" , \".\" )) else : next_fee = None return next_fee The rest of the script has been covered in the previous section. For simulations ran in the backend, a similar script is available here . Implement dynamic grid fees with Aziiz strategy \u00b6 The Aziiz strategy, named after the researcher who suggested this model , is using past market information to determine the next grid fee. The model looks at past imports and exports on a specific market, applies a moving average and then based on this number sets the next grid fee for that market. This model has the advantage of integrating market conditions into its strategy. For instance, if past market slots experienced high imports, the model will increase fees in the relevant market to incentivise market participants to contain the energy within that market. A template script can be found here . With this strategy, two more parameters are available at the beginning of the script and can be tuned: MOVING_AVERAGE_PEAK = True LOOK_BACK_INDEX = 4 If MOVING_AVERAGE_PEAK is set to True, the Aziiz strategy will compare the average of the last markets\u2019 (how many is defined by the LOOK_BACK_INDEX parameter) peak import/export to the threshold. The on_market_slot event is used to request market statistics from the simulation, based on which import / export balance can be calculated for each market. This is the criteria to determine which grid fees to apply in each market. def calculate_import_export_balance ( self ): \"\"\"Calculate the balance (import - export) for each market.\"\"\" self . dso_stats_response = self . execute_batch_commands () for market_event in self . dso_stats_response [ \"responses\" ] . items (): self . import_kwh [ market_event [ 1 ][ 0 ][ \"name\" ]] = market_event [ 1 ][ 0 ][ \"market_stats\" ][ \"area_throughput\" ][ \"import\" ] self . export_kwh [ market_event [ 1 ][ 0 ][ \"name\" ]] = market_event [ 1 ][ 0 ][ \"market_stats\" ][ \"area_throughput\" ][ \"export\" ] self . balance [ market_event [ 1 ][ 0 ][ \"name\" ]] = ( self . import_kwh [ market_event [ 1 ][ 0 ][ \"name\" ]] - self . export_kwh [ market_event [ 1 ][ 0 ][ \"name\" ]] ) self . balance_hist . append ( self . balance ) In the Aziiz strategy, grid fees can be set for every peak import/export threshold for each market. A JSON file containing this information is uploaded to the Grid Operator API script. An example can be found here . { \"Grid\" : [ { \"Import / Export threshold\" : 10 , \"Grid fee\" : 0.9 }, { \"Import / Export threshold\" : 15 , \"Grid fee\" : 2.1 }, { \"Import / Export threshold\" : 20 , \"Grid fee\" : 3 }, { \"Import / Export threshold\" : 25 , \"Grid fee\" : 3.9 }, { \"Import / Export threshold\" : 30 , \"Grid fee\" : 6 }, { \"Import / Export threshold\" : 50 , \"Grid fee\" : 30 } ], \"Community\" : [ { \"Import / Export threshold\" : 10 , \"Grid fee\" : 0.9 }, { \"Import / Export threshold\" : 15 , \"Grid fee\" : 2.1 }, { \"Import / Export threshold\" : 20 , \"Grid fee\" : 3 }, { \"Import / Export threshold\" : 25 , \"Grid fee\" : 3.9 }, { \"Import / Export threshold\" : 30 , \"Grid fee\" : 6 }, { \"Import / Export threshold\" : 50 , \"Grid fee\" : 30 } ] } If the average is lower than the threshold, the relevant grid fee will be applied; for instance in the figure above, if the average peak is equal to 22 kWh, the next grid fee will be 3 cents/KWh. Below is a snippet of the _set_new_market_fee adapted to the Aziiz strategy. All the fees are added to the batch command and then executed. def _set_new_market_fee ( self ): \"\"\"Return the market fees for each market for the next time slot.\"\"\" next_market_fee = {} for area_uuid , area_dict in self . latest_grid_tree_flat . items (): if area_dict [ \"area_name\" ] in MARKET_NAMES : if MOVING_AVERAGE_PEAK : fees = [] for balance in self . balance_hist : fees . append ( balance [ area_dict [ \"area_name\" ]]) max_ext_energy_kwh = abs ( sum ( fees [ - LOOK_BACK_INDEX :]) / len ( fees [ - LOOK_BACK_INDEX :]) ) else : max_ext_energy_kwh = max ( self . import_kwh [ area_dict [ \"area_name\" ]], self . export_kwh [ area_dict [ \"area_name\" ]], ) individual_market_fees = fee_strategy [ area_dict [ \"area_name\" ]] for market_fee in individual_market_fees : if max_ext_energy_kwh <= market_fee [ \"Import / Export threshold\" ]: next_market_fee [ area_dict [ \"area_name\" ]] = market_fee [ \"Grid fee\" ] break next_market_fee [ area_dict [ \"area_name\" ]] = 2000 self . add_to_batch_commands . grid_fees ( area_uuid = area_uuid , fee_cents_kwh = next_market_fee [ area_dict [ \"area_name\" ]], ) self . execute_batch_commands () return next_market_fee The rest of the script has been already covered in this previous section.

Other heat pump configuration parameters can be modified to suit a particular use case in the backend, as described in the Heat Pump Code Configuration section. Heat Pump Asset Trading Strategy \u00b6 The heat hump places bids for electrical energy ranging from an initial to final buying rate, with prices increasing incrementally within the market slot upon the update interval. Asset owners (or managers) can either set the final rate as a default preferred buying rate or select a preferred buying rate based on a smart trading algorithm. When the heat pump bids are below the preferred buying rate, the heat pump tries to consume as much energy as possible to satisfy the demand, while also charging the thermal storage for future use, thus maximising the benefit from lower electricity prices ( case a ). On the other hand, if the electricity price is higher than the specified buying price, the heat pump only consumes the required energy to maintain the storage at the same temperature level as the one before the energy trade occurs (i.e. consumes only the energy required to satisfy the asset owner\u2019s heat demand), aiming to minimise the costs incurred by the increased energy prices ( case b ). a. Bid rate <= Preferred buying rate \u00b6 If the bid price is below the preferred buying rate, the heat pump strategy is to consume the maximum amount of energy. The maximum energy that the heat pump can buy at any point in time is calculated based on the following equation: \\[ E_{to buy} = min(P_{max} * t_{slot}, (T_{max} - T_{curr} + T_{decrease}) * (0.00116 * V_{tank} * \\rho_{water}) / COP) \\] where \\(P_{max}\\) is the maximum power rating \\(t_{slot}\\) is the slot length \\(T_{max}\\) is the maximum temperature of the storage tank \\(T_{curr}\\) is the current temperature of the storage tank \\(T_{decrease}\\) is the temperature decrease of the storage tank due to heat consumption 0.00116 is the energy required to heat one litre of water by 1 \u00b0C, in kWh \\(V_{tank}\\) is the volume of the storage tank \\(\\rho_{water}\\) is the density of water \\(COP\\) is the coefficient of performance of the heat pump; depends on the heat pump type, and \\(\\Delta T = T_{curr} - T_{ambient}\\) Note: \\(COP\\) calculation generally follows the model proposed by Ruhnau et al. using the following input parameters (termed here Universal COP model): Ambient temperature (temperature of the source of the heat, dependent on the type; this could be water (brine) or air) Comfort temperature (temperature of the sink i.e. the current temperature of the heat pump storage) Heat pump type (water-to-water or air-to-water) Alternatively, the user can select one of two pre-trained COP models developed by Tekniker deploying the DOE-2 building energy analysis program to yield a statistical model by leveraging measurements of select heat pump manufacturers under predefined operational conditions: a) ELCO_AEROTOP_G07_14M or b) HOVAL_ULTRASOURCE_B_COMFORT_C11. To train additional models, please find the guidelines and scripts here . To determine the heat pump trading strategy , the COP is calculated for each market slot taking into account the current storage temperature and the ambient temperature. b. Bid rate > Preferred buying rate \u00b6 In this situation, the heat pump strategy is to consume the least possible amount of energy in order to keep the temperature at the same level, since the prices are relatively high. Two different situations can arise: \\(T_{curr} > T_{min} + T_{decrease}\\) : In this case, the heat pump does not consume any energy (it\u2019s not commanded to function because the temperature will be within the temperature limits even if some heat is consumed in the market slot). Therefore, \\(E_{tobuy} = 0\\) \\(T_{curr} <= T_{min} + T_{decrease}\\) : In this case the heat pump is forced to function, and it consumes the energy to maintain the temperature at the minimum, taking into account the energy consumption of the user\u2019s premise. In all cases, the maximum power rating is respected, meaning that not more energy is requested than the energy equivalent of the Maximum Power Rating, as illustrated in graphs below: Figure 2.27 : Grid Singularity Exchange Heat Pump Digital Twin: Initial, Final and Preferred Buying Rate in relation to Minimum and Maximum Energy Consumed Figure 2.28 : Grid Singularity Exchange heat pump digital twin example of function to maintain temperature within comfort limits, with the horizontal axis showing timestamps for the selected date and the vertical axis showing temperature in \u00b0C", "title": "Heat Pump"}, {"location": "heat-pump/#heat-pump-asset-configuration-options", "text": "", "title": "Heat Pump Asset Configuration Options"}, {"location": "heat-pump/#heat-pump-configuration-express-mode", "text": "In the express heat pump configuration mode, the user is provided with a template (synthetic) heat pump model to include as an asset at a selected location in the simulated local energy market by naming the asset and setting its location: Name: select a unique name for the heat pump; Location: the location selected by the user is automatically uploaded.

Depending on the external temperature and the heating needs, a heat pump usually has a coefficient of performance (COP) of around 2-4 , which means that it is able to produce 2-4 kWh of heat by consuming 1 kWh of electricity. In the Grid Singularity Exchange, the heat pump is modelled as a load, which consumes electricity and generates heat (see heat pump configuration options here ). If the heat pump has a storage option (water tank) then this is accounted for by a dedicated heat pump asset trading strategy , which facilitates flexibility trading by leveraging the heat storage capabilities of the water tank. For homes (or other energy community participants) that are connected to district heating we have developed a digital twin of a heat pump that mimics and replaces the heat demand currently satisfied by a district heating network, modelled as a virtual heat pump (VHP) with storage and a related trading strategy. This VHP implementation is available exclusively in the backend source code , since it will likely be used exclusively by energy researchers to simulate how district heating could be replaced by a heat pump to compare their respective performance. Inversely, the VHP can also be used to calculate the heat demand of homes or other energy community participants, and consequently enable the simulation of a district heating connection that would satisfy this heat demand as opposed to electricity assets. Finally, for simulations that simply want to account for the district heating connection without considering a potential replacement with heat pumps, the digital twin of the district heating supply for the measured heat demand can be modelled as a \"heat market maker\", i.e. digital trading agent with a specific trading strategy representing the district heating provider, which will only sell heat energy to the heat demand digital twin of the respective community member. The selling price of this market maker will be the district heating price that the heat consumer currently pays, in cents/kWh. The heat demand digital twin, in turn, is modelled as a load with a \u201cconsumption profile\u201d defined by the measured heat demand in kWh. Thus, the \u201cheat market maker\u201d will only be used in order to cover the heat demand of the heat load, accounting for the monetary cost of heating.

Since efficient storage of large quantities of energy is currently not economically feasible and electrical current varies within seconds, a market mechanism that efficiently accounts for the physical energy production and consumption is required. Generally, trading occurs in the following types of markets with different time intervals: Spot market : short-term trades for immediate or near-term delivery. Energy transactions are divided into small time blocks (typically 15-minute slots) that can either be traded on the Day-ahead or in the Intraday market. Balancing market : trades for balancing capacity, procured by the balancing responsible parties (BRP). The traded energy capacity can be activated in order to mitigate any grid imbalances and to ensure the physical balance between generation and production. Settlement market : post-delivery trades of deviations between energy physically produced/consumed and energy purchased in the spot or futures market to settle imbalances locally before BRP billing. Flexibility market : short-term markets, where flexibility is bought shortly before it is needed on the network (day-ahead, or even intraday). Futures market : Trades for the longer term future consumption and production of energy are agreed in advance. This market is currently in development of Grid Singularity energy exchange implementation. Community trading / peer-to-market type : assumes a collective self-consumption scheme, where the energy generation in the community is aggregated and then allocated in a predetermined allocation coefficient to each member. In this case, the trading only occurs between one community member and one renewable asset, usually member-owned or community-owned and shared solar panel (PV) rather than among all assets in the community. The current implementation of Grid Singularity Exchange focuses on peer-to-peer spot and balancing markets, with a commercial peer-to-market community trading application available via Grid Singularity\u2019s Social Community Manager . Balancing markets take place immediately after each spot market slot (if enabled). The duration of the markets can be configured. Figure 3.5 : Market Types implemented in the Grid Singularity Exchange Simulated Time \u00b6 Simulated time is the time unit within a simulation as opposed to real-time which is the real-life time that the simulation takes (seven days of trading can be simulated in minutes or hours). Market Slots \u00b6 The energy spot market is divided into time slots, with the default in the Grid Singularity simulation interface (Singularity Map) set to 15 minutes of simulated time. For a one-day simulation, 96 market slots would occur with the default setting. Learn how to adjust market slot length here . Depending on the market type, bids and offers are either matched within or at the end of each slot. Bids and offers that remain unmatched at the end of a market slot are annulled, and assets may be penalised for any energy they physically produce or consume that is not transacted. Market Ticks \u00b6 Each market slot is further segmented into ticks. The default setting for a tick is 15 seconds of simulated time, and this configuration may be changed. The default 15-minute market slot is made up of 60 15-second ticks. In a pay-as-bid market, for instance, the market is cleared at the end of each tick. If an order is not matched, it is propagated to the hierarchically higher and lower markets by a Market Agent after two ticks). If an order is not matched at the end of two next ticks, it is further propagated to connected markets in the subsequent ticks following the same logic. Spot Market \u00b6 In a local energy market (LEM), bids and offers are matched according to the selected market mechanism. A market mechanism is a category of algorithms that ensures that energy bids are associated with energy offers in a way that the energy price of both the bids and the offers is successfully met. In addition to that, a market mechanism is responsible for calculating the clearing price, which is the price that the consumer of energy pays to the producer of energy for each bid-offer match. Studies show that different market mechanisms offer diverse benefits and limitations relating to market efficiency, fairness, and user choices. In the Grid Singularity Exchange (previously termed D3A), three spot market mechanisms are implemented: One-Sided Pay-as-Offer Market Two-Sided Pay-as-Bid Market Two-Sided Pay-as-Clear Market One-Sided Pay-as-Offer Market \u00b6 In the One-Sided Pay-as-Offer market, trading agents representing energy producers, including prosumers (hereinafter termed \"sellers\") post offers in the market with an energy price determined by the asset trading strategies . Agents representing consumers (hereinafter termed \u201cbuyers\u201d) can see the offers available in their local market, filter affordable offers and then select the most favourable offer. The energy rate upon which the seller and buyer settle is the price of the offer (pay-as-offer). Consequently, the trade rate may differ for trades settled in the same slot. The auction is continuous, meaning that once an offer is posted, it can be accepted immediately, even before the end of each market slot. Two-Sided Pay-as-Bid Market \u00b6 In the Two-Sided Pay-as-Bid market, buyers are able to place bids in the market, alongside the offers placed by sellers. Each market collects and matches bids and offers issued by trading agents, and dispatches bids and offers to other markets via a Market Agent, which is created automatically in the Grid Singularity Exchange for each market in order to forward bids and offers to the connected markets. The auction in the Two-Sided Pay-as-Bid is continuous, meaning that once an offer or bid is posted, it can be matched immediately, even before the end of the market slot. Bids and offers can also be annulled by the Market Agent, in case the asset that created the offer or bid that was forwarded decides to delete it ifit no longer intends to procure or sell its energy. In such a case, the asset notifies the relevant Market Agent that the offer or bid is no longer available, and removes the forwarded offer or bid from the market. Similarly, the price of the forwarded offers and bids can be updated by the Market Agent. The market constantly triggers the matching between bids and offers according to the matching algorithm as illustrated in the figure below. Figure 3.6 : Two-Sided Pay-as-Bid Market Mechanism in the Grid Singularity Exchange Two-Sided Pay-as-Clear Market \u00b6 In the Two-Sided Pay-as-Clear market, buyers are able to place bids in the market alongside the offers placed by sellers. The market collects and matches bids and offers issued by trading agents, and dispatches bids and offers to other markets via the Market Agent. Bids and offers can also be annulled by the trading agent. Market Agents are created automatically in the Grid Singularity Exchange for each market, in order to forward bids and offers to the connected markets . Currently, there is a merit-order-effect mechanism implemented for bid and offer matching where bids and offers are aggregated and cleared in a specified clearing interval. At the end of each interval, bids are arranged in a descending order, offers in an ascending order and the equilibrium quantity of energy and price is calculated. The clearing point (the quantity of energy that is accepted trade volume for a specific energy rate clearing price) is determined by the point where the arranged bid curve for the buyers drops below the offer curve for the sellers. Figure 3.7 : Two-Sided Pay-as-Clear Market Mechanism in the Grid Singularity Exchange The highest bids are matched with the lowest offers. The matching rate is the clearing price (cents/kWh). The remaining bids and offers (right of the clearing point in the plot above) are not cleared at this clearing point and remain in the market for later matching. Balancing Market \u00b6 The Grid Singularity Exchange bottom-up market design allows participants to engage in local energy markets (LEM) for energy trading, providing energy balance at a local level. Grid Singularity\u2019s implementation of a balancing market also facilitates the procurement of flexibility locally from LEM participants to assist the distribution grid operators (DSOs) in balancing the grid. At the moment, this implementation is available only by using the Grid Singularity Exchange backend code. The following sections describe the balancing market structure and explain our approach. Balancing Market Structure \u00b6 Electrical power systems are characterised by voltage and frequency and the flow of electricity is a continuous process. Buffering or storing electrical energy at each node is still not feasible, and therefore electrical energy needs to be generated exactly at the time of consumption. Differences in supply and demand causes the nominal frequency (50Hz in EU) to deviate. Consequently, supply and demand need to be monitored in real time to implement adjustments to maintain equilibrium and nominal frequency, avoiding cascading effect culminating in a blackout . Transmission system operators (TSOs) ensure the continuation of operation of the transmission grid during significant transient faults. They oversee fast, flexible, fossil fuel-based and / or renewable generation units, energy storage systems (e.g. battery power plants) and manage the demand response service, implementing frequency control strategies to balance electrical systems. Each control strategy has specific purposes and features and can be categorised in three groups, as shown in the figure below. Primary Control (Frequency Containment Reserve - FCR) Secondary Control (Automatic Frequency Restoration Reserves - aFRR) Tertiary Control (Manual Frequency Restoration Reserves - mFRR) Figure 3.8 : The three tiers of grid control and its activation structure (source: Karel de Brabandere, Voltage and Frequency Droop Control in Low Voltage Grids by Distributed Generators with Inverter Front-End , Engineering, 2006) In conventional grid structures: Primary control is an automatic function that is almost instantaneously activated to stabilise the frequency drops/spikes. It is the fastest type of frequency control with a response time of a few seconds and operates using a joint process involving all TSOs of the synchronous area. This is shown in the figure below. For example, if there is an increase in demand, the energy used to compensate for this demand comes from the kinetic energy stored in large rotating synchronous generators that start decreasing its velocity. This is referred to as inertial response . For the generators to recover the speed, the speed controller of each generator acts to increase the generator power to clear the imbalance. Within a period of 30 seconds, each generating unit is able to generate the required power and stabilise this production for at least 15 minutes or depending on the requirements of the TSO within the synchronous region. Primary control is done using generation plants that are connected to the high voltage power supply with the exception of renewable energy sources which are non-schedulable due to its intermittent nature. Figure 3.9 : Recovery of the system from a contingency event and action by primary frequency control (source: Paul Denholm, Trieu Mai, Rick Wallace Kenyon, Ben Kroposki, and Mark O\u2019Malley, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Inertia and the Power Grid: A Guide Without the Spin , May 2020) Secondary control is performed automatically by all the generators to restore the nominal frequency, the power exchanges and reserve of the generators used in primary control. The generators involved in this regulation function through dedicated reserve power that are set in conjunction with central controllers. The reserve control power is negotiated in a contract conjunction with the TSO and is a percentage of the maximum available power with a predefined minimum value to ensure that it can be dispatched whenever needed. This service is remunerated according to the set contracts. Tertiary control is not an automatic function and is executed upon request by the grid operator. The reserve margins used for the secondary control are restored through tertiary control. The differences between the primary, secondary and tertiary frequency control is the time the production and response can be activated, and the remuneration for each. Primary frequency control is symmetrical as the capacity for control has been scheduled and usually balances between ramping up and down the production and therefore not remunerated. Secondary and tertiary control are not symmetrical as the capacity can be used only for ramping up or down the production to restore the frequency and are remunerated. Review of the three levels of regulation \u00b6 Response Time Duration Time Operation Purpose Primary Control 10-30 Seconds 15 Minutes Automatic Act in case of frequency variation in order to stabilise frequency value Secondary Control 200 Seconds 120 minutes Automatic Act to bring back frequency value to the nominal value and restore the power reserve of the generators used for the primary frequency control Tertiary Control 15 Minutes Indicated by TSO Upon Request Act to restore power reserves of the generators used for the secondary frequency control Table 3.1 : Main features of frequency control strategies In our transactive energy low voltage grid structure primary, secondary and tertiary control are controlled by a variation of the Market Agent, termed the Balancing Agent for this market type. The Balancing Agent is responsible for monitoring power imbalances in the segment of the electricity grid that it controls, and it compensates for these imbalances with the balancing energy purchased by the community assets in the balancing market. It therefore also manages communication to the balancing market and it manages trading in the balancing markets for different segments of the electricity grid. Primary control happens simultaneously as the spot market through a droop curve. Grid forming assets have different droop curves based on their behaviour (Consumption Profiles/Loads, Storage/Battery, Solar Panel/PV) which are used to keep the voltage and frequency towards nominal in case of a deviation. Local balancing is therefore done through primary control. Secondary control (Inertia Control) is done through a time schedule. The schedule is received from the upper tertiary control or from a ledger. Secondary Balancing Agents adjust the primary Balancing Agents resources within its market by disconnecting and connecting them in case of failure of upstream structure or failure to meet the schedule. Tertiary control negotiates the schedules upstream or downstream at lowest cost of operation and provides a marketplace for energy in and out of the market area. The inputs of the tertiary control are the bids, offers and error signals from secondary control. The outputs are the schedules to resources. Balancing Market Implementation in the Grid Singularity Exchange \u00b6 Figure 3.10 : Structure of Balancing Market in Grid Singularity Exchange Balancing Assets \u00b6 In the Grid Singularity Exchange, balancing has been implemented using: Fast responding non-critical loads to provide load shedding Battery storage Commercial power plants The trading strategies of energy assets can be used to balance the grid by placing balancing offers. These assets participate in the balancing market only if they are registered in the Balancing Asset Registry. Balancing Asset Registry \u00b6 The Balancing Asset Registry is a dictionary that contains the names of assets as keys and the balancing rates as tuple values: (demand balancing rate, supply balancing rate). asset_registry_dict = { \"H1 General Load\" : ( 33 , 35 ), \"H2 General Load\" : ( 33 , 35 ), \"H1 Storage1\" : ( 33 , 35 ), \"H1 Storage2\" : ( 33 , 35 ), } Balancing Market Type \u00b6 The present balancing market type setting is a One-Sided Pay-as-Offer market , which accepts balancing_offers from energy assets and connected hierarchies of balancing_market . balancing_offers could be positive or negative. It also facilitates the balancing_trade . Balancing Agent \u00b6 The Balancing Agent follows the lead of the spot_market_trade of its lower hierarchy. Whenever there is a trade in the lower hierarchy of spot_market , it will try to secure a share of spot market trades in the balancing market. Balancing Market Constant Parameters \u00b6 The following are the constant parameters related to the balancing market, with defaults available here . ENABLE_BALANCING_MARKET \u2192 (Default: False) (It enables the simulation with Balancing Market) BALANCING_SPOT_TRADE_RATIO \u2192 (Default: 0.2) (It dictates the ratio of spot_market_energy to be traded in balancing market) BALANCING_OFFER_DEMAND_RATIO \u2192 (Default: 0.1) (It dictates the ratio of spot_market_energy to be offered in balancing market as demand_balancing_offer) BALANCING_OFFER_SUPPLY_RATIO \u2192 (Default: 0.1) (It dictates the ratio of spot_market_energy to be offered in balancing market as supply_balancing_offer) BALANCING_FLEXIBLE_LOADS_SUPPORT \u2192 (Default: True) (It enables Load Trading Strategy to place supply_balancing_offer - effectively curtailing it's load) Examples of balancing market setups are available here . Settlement Market \u00b6 Settlement Market Structure \u00b6 Spot and futures trading requires predictions of energy use at both the asset and network level, which are often associated with high prediction errors. Thus, although a balancing mechanism should deal with the energy imbalances on the physical level, financial exchanges might still not be settled, causing a mismatch between physical energy delivery and market accounting. Some market approaches create orders and matches based on the last 15-minute slot\u2019s energy use (post-delivery, read by smart metres) to solve this problem. Others allow the grid operator to set prices or enforce penalties for any deviance Symbiotic Energy Markets concept espoused by Grid Singularity\u2019s technical approach allows similar post-delivery trading by all market participants. Deviations between energy physically produced/consumed and energy purchased in the spot or futures market can be traded post-delivery by submitting a time slot in the past as a requirement attached to a bid or offer, creating a settlement market (figure 3.8). Bids and offers will be matched leveraging the Two-Sided Pay-as-Bid matching mechanism . This allows local deviations to balance without penalty (e.g. a local solar panel that overproduces matches their deviation to a local load that over-consumed), with the remainder filled at a market rate (likely a premium) by individual assets, balancing groups, or grid operators that provided balancing services during delivery. A specific limit may be introduced to represent the time interval in which post-delivery trading can be conducted. Figure 3.11 : Energy deviations (difference between purchased and delivered energy) can be traded in the settlement market instead of paying a penalty to the grid operator, reducing inefficient accounting. Any remaining deviance can still be penalised by the grid operator. Settlement Market Implementation in the Grid Singularity Exchange backend \u00b6 Settlement Market Settings \u00b6 If ConstSettings.SettlementMarketSettings.ENABLE_SETTLEMENT_MARKETS is set to True, settlement markets are created for each market cycle. For each past spot market, there is always a respective settlement market. The settlement market order book is kept open for placing bids and offers for a number of hours after energy delivery, which the user sets with Const.Settings.SettlementMarketSettings.MAX_AGE_SETTLEMENT_MARKET_HOURS , contrary to the operation of the spot market, which keeps its order book open for 15 minutes (starting 15 minutes before the energy delivery). Spot and settlement markets are functionally connected.By accessing trades of the corresponding spot market for the energy delivery period, the settlement market reads the traded energy by each asset and compares it with energy measurements of each asset, calculating any energy deviation of the expected consumed or produced energy. Figure 3.12 : Example of settlement markets available for each market slot and their time rotation in the Grid Singularity Exchange Asset Trading Strategies in Settlement Markets \u00b6 Prosumer assets can post orders (bids/offers) of their energy deviations to the settlement market in order to get compensated by another entity that deviated inversely. Energy deviations are calculated as the difference between the forecasted and measured production or consumption. Asset owners or asset aggregators (other entities managing energy assets on behalf of the asset owners) can post the forecasted and measured energy to the Grid Singularity Exchange for each market slot via the Asset API with the batch commands set_energy_forecast and set_energy_measurement . Posting and updating bids and offers in settlement markets functions in the same way as in the spot markets. The asset can provide its desired energy delivery period for which it wants to contribute to the settlement operation, by using the time_slot attribute of the bid and the offer. The asset can also define the settlement energy that it is willing to procure or sell, which is at most the amount of energy deviation of the asset for the energy delivery period. Figure 3.13 : Settlement market posting energy deviations mechanism with external asset strategies Integrated Asset Strategies in Settlement Markets \u00b6 The Grid Singularity Exchange includes integrated trading strategies for the settlement market for all supported assets, enabling their automated participation to the settlement market without any intervention from the asset owner. The settlement trading strategies are extensions of the asset trading strategies , with the additional abilities to measure the energy deviation of the asset prosumption and to use this deviation for posting bids and offers to the settlement markets. Since they are extensions of the asset trading strategies, the settlement trading strategies participate in the spot market in exactly the same way as the asset trading strategies. Depending on the forecasted energy for the asset (as described in detail here ), they post bids and offers to the spot market first. After some energy is traded on the spot market, the settlement trading strategies wait for the energy delivery and then verify that the traded energy from the asset corresponds to the produced or consumed energy of the asset. If there is an energy deviation between the traded energy and the measured energy, the settlement trading strategies use this deviation for posting a bid or offer with energy value equal to the energy deviation of the asset. For example, if a PV forecasted to produce 5kWh of energy for the 12:00 market, but the simulated measured energy reveals that the it only produced 4kWh for that time slot, the template strategy will post a bid to the 12:00 settlement market with the energy 1kWh. The behaviour for the price increase of this bid is the same as in the spot market: the energy rate of the bid is increased during the market until the Final selling rate is reached. As the settlement market will stay available for longer than the normal spot market (configurable by Const.Settings.SettlementMarketSettings.MAX_AGE_SETTLEMENT_MARKET_HOURS , please also see here ), the template strategy will not update the orders as frequently as in the normal spot market, but following the time interval set by the parameter SettlementTemplateStrategiesConstants.UPDATE_INTERVAL_MIN . Figure 3.14 : Settlement market posting energy deviations mechanism with template asset strategies Community Trading Market \u00b6 Currently, EU members like Spain support peer-to-market energy trading, meaning that the regulator determines a single trading price for the community. The community manager in this type of jurisdiction can choose to enable community trading or to exclusively allow energy sharing of local generation. The latter is also known as a collective self-consumption scheme, where the energy generation in the community is aggregated and then allocated in a predetermined allocation coefficient to each member. These coefficients are set by the energy community manager and are usually based on the share of generation that is owned or leased by the individual community member. The price of external energy supply to match any demand that is not satisfied locally is determined by the supplier (utility rate) and the price of local generation sold to the grid by the applicable feed-in-tariffs. Other charges include grid fees and taxes to account for network costs and in some EU countries these are subsidised. Finally, there are fees applied by the energy community manager that also include the cost of the SCM tool provided by Grid Singularity and may include additional charges for supplying data measurement devices or any support services. To this the cost of leasing any renewable energy like solar is added for those who use that service. All of these components are illustrated in the energy community member application interface.", "title": "Grid Singularity Exchange Market Types"}, {"location": "market-types/#simulated-time", "text": "Simulated time is the time unit within a simulation as opposed to real-time which is the real-life time that the simulation takes (seven days of trading can be simulated in minutes or hours).", "title": "Simulated Time"}, {"location": "market-types/#market-slots", "text": "The energy spot market is divided into time slots, with the default in the Grid Singularity simulation interface (Singularity Map) set to 15 minutes of simulated time.

Buffering or storing electrical energy at each node is still not feasible, and therefore electrical energy needs to be generated exactly at the time of consumption. Differences in supply and demand causes the nominal frequency (50Hz in EU) to deviate. Consequently, supply and demand need to be monitored in real time to implement adjustments to maintain equilibrium and nominal frequency, avoiding cascading effect culminating in a blackout . Transmission system operators (TSOs) ensure the continuation of operation of the transmission grid during significant transient faults. They oversee fast, flexible, fossil fuel-based and / or renewable generation units, energy storage systems (e.g. battery power plants) and manage the demand response service, implementing frequency control strategies to balance electrical systems. Each control strategy has specific purposes and features and can be categorised in three groups, as shown in the figure below. Primary Control (Frequency Containment Reserve - FCR) Secondary Control (Automatic Frequency Restoration Reserves - aFRR) Tertiary Control (Manual Frequency Restoration Reserves - mFRR) Figure 3.8 : The three tiers of grid control and its activation structure (source: Karel de Brabandere, Voltage and Frequency Droop Control in Low Voltage Grids by Distributed Generators with Inverter Front-End , Engineering, 2006) In conventional grid structures: Primary control is an automatic function that is almost instantaneously activated to stabilise the frequency drops/spikes. It is the fastest type of frequency control with a response time of a few seconds and operates using a joint process involving all TSOs of the synchronous area. This is shown in the figure below. For example, if there is an increase in demand, the energy used to compensate for this demand comes from the kinetic energy stored in large rotating synchronous generators that start decreasing its velocity. This is referred to as inertial response . For the generators to recover the speed, the speed controller of each generator acts to increase the generator power to clear the imbalance. Within a period of 30 seconds, each generating unit is able to generate the required power and stabilise this production for at least 15 minutes or depending on the requirements of the TSO within the synchronous region. Primary control is done using generation plants that are connected to the high voltage power supply with the exception of renewable energy sources which are non-schedulable due to its intermittent nature. Figure 3.9 : Recovery of the system from a contingency event and action by primary frequency control (source: Paul Denholm, Trieu Mai, Rick Wallace Kenyon, Ben Kroposki, and Mark O\u2019Malley, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Inertia and the Power Grid: A Guide Without the Spin , May 2020) Secondary control is performed automatically by all the generators to restore the nominal frequency, the power exchanges and reserve of the generators used in primary control. The generators involved in this regulation function through dedicated reserve power that are set in conjunction with central controllers. The reserve control power is negotiated in a contract conjunction with the TSO and is a percentage of the maximum available power with a predefined minimum value to ensure that it can be dispatched whenever needed. This service is remunerated according to the set contracts. Tertiary control is not an automatic function and is executed upon request by the grid operator. The reserve margins used for the secondary control are restored through tertiary control.

The Balancing Agent is responsible for monitoring power imbalances in the segment of the electricity grid that it controls, and it compensates for these imbalances with the balancing energy purchased by the community assets in the balancing market. It therefore also manages communication to the balancing market and it manages trading in the balancing markets for different segments of the electricity grid. Primary control happens simultaneously as the spot market through a droop curve. Grid forming assets have different droop curves based on their behaviour (Consumption Profiles/Loads, Storage/Battery, Solar Panel/PV) which are used to keep the voltage and frequency towards nominal in case of a deviation. Local balancing is therefore done through primary control. Secondary control (Inertia Control) is done through a time schedule. The schedule is received from the upper tertiary control or from a ledger. Secondary Balancing Agents adjust the primary Balancing Agents resources within its market by disconnecting and connecting them in case of failure of upstream structure or failure to meet the schedule. Tertiary control negotiates the schedules upstream or downstream at lowest cost of operation and provides a marketplace for energy in and out of the market area.

This allows local deviations to balance without penalty (e.g. a local solar panel that overproduces matches their deviation to a local load that over-consumed), with the remainder filled at a market rate (likely a premium) by individual assets, balancing groups, or grid operators that provided balancing services during delivery. A specific limit may be introduced to represent the time interval in which post-delivery trading can be conducted.

Spot and settlement markets are functionally connected.By accessing trades of the corresponding spot market for the energy delivery period, the settlement market reads the traded energy by each asset and compares it with energy measurements of each asset, calculating any energy deviation of the expected consumed or produced energy.

Posting and updating bids and offers in settlement markets functions in the same way as in the spot markets. The asset can provide its desired energy delivery period for which it wants to contribute to the settlement operation, by using the time_slot attribute of the bid and the offer. The asset can also define the settlement energy that it is willing to procure or sell, which is at most the amount of energy deviation of the asset for the energy delivery period.

The settlement trading strategies are extensions of the asset trading strategies , with the additional abilities to measure the energy deviation of the asset prosumption and to use this deviation for posting bids and offers to the settlement markets. Since they are extensions of the asset trading strategies, the settlement trading strategies participate in the spot market in exactly the same way as the asset trading strategies. Depending on the forecasted energy for the asset (as described in detail here ), they post bids and offers to the spot market first. After some energy is traded on the spot market, the settlement trading strategies wait for the energy delivery and then verify that the traded energy from the asset corresponds to the produced or consumed energy of the asset. If there is an energy deviation between the traded energy and the measured energy, the settlement trading strategies use this deviation for posting a bid or offer with energy value equal to the energy deviation of the asset. For example, if a PV forecasted to produce 5kWh of energy for the 12:00 market, but the simulated measured energy reveals that the it only produced 4kWh for that time slot, the template strategy will post a bid to the 12:00 settlement market with the energy 1kWh. The behaviour for the price increase of this bid is the same as in the spot market: the energy rate of the bid is increased during the market until the Final selling rate is reached. As the settlement market will stay available for longer than the normal spot market (configurable by Const.Settings.SettlementMarketSettings.MAX_AGE_SETTLEMENT_MARKET_HOURS , please also see here ), the template strategy will not update the orders as frequently as in the normal spot market, but following the time interval set by the parameter SettlementTemplateStrategiesConstants.UPDATE_INTERVAL_MIN .

The latter is also known as a collective self-consumption scheme, where the energy generation in the community is aggregated and then allocated in a predetermined allocation coefficient to each member. These coefficients are set by the energy community manager and are usually based on the share of generation that is owned or leased by the individual community member. The price of external energy supply to match any demand that is not satisfied locally is determined by the supplier (utility rate) and the price of local generation sold to the grid by the applicable feed-in-tariffs. Other charges include grid fees and taxes to account for network costs and in some EU countries these are subsidised. Finally, there are fees applied by the energy community manager that also include the cost of the SCM tool provided by Grid Singularity and may include additional charges for supplying data measurement devices or any support services.

Since efficient storage of large quantities of energy is currently not economically feasible and electrical current varies within seconds, a market mechanism that efficiently accounts for the physical energy production and consumption is required. Generally, trading occurs in three types of markets with different time intervals: Spot market : short-term trades for immediate or near-term delivery. Energy transactions are divided into small time blocks (typically 15 minute slots) that can either be traded on the Day-ahead or in the Intraday market. Balancing market : imbalances that occur due to deviations between energy traded in the spot market and actual energy consumption and production are absorbed by balance responsible parties (BRP) that are reimbursed for their service with a fee based on the energy deviation. Futures market : trades for the longer term future consumption and production of energy are agreed in advance. This market is currently outside the scope of Grid Singularity energy exchange implementation. The current implementation of Grid Singularity software focuses on the spot and balancing markets. Balancing markets take place immediately after each spot market slot (if enabled). The duration of the markets can be configured. Currently, three spot market types are implemented: One-sided Pay-as-Offer Two-sided Pay-as-Bid Two-sided Pay-as-Clear Market Slots \u00b6 The energy spot market is broken into time slots, with the default set to 15 minutes of simulated time.

Figure . Flow diagram of the role of matching engines (third party matching algorithm providers) in the Grid Singularity Exchange. Trading process through the Matching API: Bids and Offers creation - Bids and Offers are created on behalf of the energy assets (either by using the default GSy trading strategy or through the Asset API ) and sent to the exchange. Order book - The exchange gathers the bids and offers for all the different markets, which are currently organised in a hierarchical structure . Request Bids and Offers - The Matching API requests bids and offers for specific markets , and receives a dictionary containing all bids and offers posted in the chosen markets. Matching - The Matching API pairs bids and offers together according to an external matching algorithm provided by a third-party matching algorithm provider and sends the proposed bid/offer pairs (technically called recommendations ) back to the exchange. Verification function - Each recommendation is submitted to the exchange\u2019s verification function, a mechanism that checks whether the clearing rate and the energy to be traded proposed by the recommendation respect the bids and offers\u2019 attributes and requirements . Transactions and rejections - Recommended matches that pass the verification function\u2019s check will be submitted as transactions in the Grid Singularity exchange. Recommendations rejected by the verification function will trigger a notification through the Matching API and not be sent to the exchange for clearing. It is important to note that the Matching API is asynchronous towards the exchange, meaning that it can request bids and offers and send recommendations at any time during the market slots .

If the cap_price_strategy is True , the offer price for the storage is calculated according to: offer_rate = initial_selling_rate - ((initial_selling_rate - final_selling_rate)\\*soc/100) As an example, considering an initial_selling_rate of 30 cents/kWh and a final_selling_rate of 20 cents/kWh, a storage with an SOC of 1% would sell its energy at 29.9 cents/kWh, and a battery at 100% SOC would sell its energy at 20 cents/kWh. Storage Behaviour in Local Energy Markets \u00b6 In general all bids and offers follow the physical constraint of the set max_abs_battery_power_kW value. The accumulated energy per market slot cannot exceed this power value times the length of the market slot.

The acceptable energy rate changes during a market slot depending on the initial_buying_rate , final_buying_rate , energy_rate_decrease_per_update and update_interval setting.

If you are running the exchange software locally, please follow the following instructions. Start Redis server \u00b6 To use the API locally, your script interacts with the simulation using a local Redis instance. To start the redis instance, open a new terminal and run the following command : redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf To install redis in Ubuntu follow the instructions in this link . Open external connection to API for Assets \u00b6 In the setup file (template available here ), an asset must be designated as open to external connection via the API. This is controlled when setting up the simulation in the setup file by designating the ExternalStrategy for each relevant energy assets : Market('Family 3 children+PV+Batt', [ Asset('Load 3 L17', strategy=LoadProfileExternalStrategy( daily_load_profile=os.path.join(current_dir, \"resources/CHR41 Family with 3 children, both at work HH1.csv\"), initial_buying_rate=Load_initial_buying_rate, final_buying_rate=Load_final_buying_rate), ), Asset('PV 3 (5kW)', strategy=PVUserProfileExternalStrategy( power_profile=os.path.join(current_dir, \"resources/Berlin_pv.csv\"), panel_count=5, initial_selling_rate=30, final_selling_rate=11), ), Asset('Tesla Powerwall 3', strategy=StorageExternalStrategy(initial_soc=10, 54min_allowed_soc=10, battery_capacity_kWh=14, max_abs_battery_power_kW=5, initial_buying_rate=0, final_buying_rate=25, initial_selling_rate=30, final_selling_rate=25.1), ), ]), By default, trading strategies do not allow API connections unless the ExternalStrategy is used. Please also ensure that the appropriate libraries are imported to use the API. Launch simulation \u00b6 This requires you to have the backend codebase installed on your machine to run simulations (see Installation Instructions ). First, navigate to the Grid Singularity folder (gsy) in a new terminal, then activate the Grid Singularity (gsy-env) environment with the command: workon gsy-env An template setup is already available in github and ready to be run here (data available for the July 2021). To run this simulation and wait for the API template script to execute: gsy-env -l INFO run -t 15s -s 15m --setup api_setup.default_community --slot-length-realtime 5 --start-date 2021-07-01 --enable-external-connection --paused After few seconds, the simulation should begin, waiting for the API template as mentioned in the figure below: Here you can find more information on launching a simulation on the backend. Initialise and start the API : \u00b6 Before launching the SDK Script, users need to adapt the following information in their script: Oracle name \u00b6 This parameter is only relevant when using the API on the User-Interface. This defines the name of the aggregator / API name that manages the markets and energy assets. Once the name is set it cannot be changed within the same running collaboration. oracle_name = 'oracle' Assets list \u00b6 The list of assets needs to be updated to include the assets registered to user through the registration process, in arrays as follows : load_names = ['Load 1 L13', 'Load 2 L21', 'Load 3 L17'] pv_names = ['PV 1 (4kW)', 'PV 3 (5kW)'] storage_names = ['Tesla Powerwall 3'] market_names = [\"Grid\", \"Community\"] The SDK Script has an \u201cautomatic\u201d connection process to manage energy assets. If the function automatic is True, the Exchange SDK will automatically connect to all energy assets that it is registered to. This option is only available for simulations running on the User-Interface. Interact with local simulations \u00b6 To interact with a locally running simulation (backend simulation), username, passwords, domain and websocket names and simulation_id are not necessary. There is only an additional flag required in the CLI command : --run-on-redis. gsy-e-sdk --log-level INFO run --setup asset_api_template --run-on-redis Log levels: \u00b6 The API CLI command can receive a --log-level argument. Adjusting this parameter will increase or reduce the level of information displayed in the terminal, while the agent is running. There are 4 levels (classed from low detailed to high: ERROR \u00b6 Display only critical errors from the Exchange SDK or the Grid Singularity Exchange (for instance, if Grid Singularity Exchange responds with an error in a command that the Exchange SDK is sending, the error log should include it) WARNING \u00b6 Display non-critical error messages (for instance if the API agent is over bidding its energy requirement) INFO \u00b6 Display critical and non-critical errors messages and general information such as market progression and trades DEBUG \u00b6 Display full information on the agent (for instance all command and response, such as placing bids and offers on the market) For a video tutorial on the Asset API, please follow this link .

The Asset API is launched with a cli command. To launch the Asset API, the user needs to open a new terminal and activate the gsy-e-sdk environment (Grid Singularity Exchange SDK). workon gsy-e-sdk And go to the GSy Exchange SDK repository cd path_to_repository/gsy-e-sdk The API launch CLI command takes several arguments that can be listed with: gsy-e-sdk run --help The arguments are : base-setup-path --> Set the base path where the user's client script resides, otherwise gsy-e-sdk/setups is taken as default for the user's client scripts. Users can provide either an absolute or a relative file path. setup --> Name of user's SDK module/script. username --> Username of agent authorised to communicate with respective collaboration/CN. password --> Password of respective agent domain-name --> Grid Singularity Exchange domain name web-socket --> Grid Singularity Exchange websocket URI simulation-id --> UUID of the collaboration or Canary Test Network simulation-config-path --> Path to the JSON file that contains the user's collaboration/CN information. run-on-redis --> This flag targets the local testing of the SDK, where no user authentication is required. A locally running redis server and a running Grid Singularity CLI simulation are needed here. The API agent can interface with a local simulation ( backend ) or a collaboration / Canary Network ( User-Interface ). There are 2 methods to parse the required information when launching the API to connect to the UI, as thoroughly explained in the text below: CLI command Environment variables CLI command: \u00b6 The user can directly pass the relevant variables as arguments in the CLI commands. For that to work, the user needs to pass the domain name and websocket name (both are optional parameters and only relevant when connecting to specific domains) and the simulation_id. The simulation_id corresponds to the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID). This token can be found in the URL of a collaboration or a Canary Test Network in the User Interface.

Requesting a Canary Network will give information about the process and requirements to set up a local energy community in your region, within regulation. A first step to setting up a Canary Network is connecting asset data sources to the simulation. Individual users can apply to participate in Canary Networks through a registry , where the exchange operator grants or denies access. Users can be invited to register through an invitation tool, and can see a list of Canary Networks to which they have been invited. Aggregators can apply through the registry to manage (i.e. run trading algorithms on behalf of) assets through the Asset API Assets can be configured to read live or uploaded data that has been sent through a live data API . The details of setting up live asset data through the API can be found here. Template scripts are available for aggregators or advanced users to trade energy through the Asset trading API. The scripts, documentation and additional information can be found here. Grid operators can also run scripts that set and change grid fees for the exchange. Both template scripts include readable text outputs from the trading or grid fee strategy Canary network results are viewable real-time, with data and trading results populated in 15 minute intervals. Results for previous weeks are available by selecting the week at the top of results. Users can view and duplicate public simulations on the map, allowing experimentation and rapid prototyping. Grid Singularity v1.5 Tutorial Version 1.4 \u00b6 The following features were implemented: A map legend has been added to clarify how colors on the map represent the exporting or importing of energy Users can add a profile picture to personalize their account by clicking on their name Custom assets can be added to a home with configurable production / consumption quantity or storage capacity through the advanced menu. Custom PVs can be added which use the energydatamap.com API, allowing a production forecast to be used for the simulation\u2019s geographical location. Advanced custom PV settings allow users to set the orientation of the PV (e.g. flat, tilted, facade) and azimuth and tilt. A list view navigation shows all assets in a home and community. Clicking on an asset allows further configuration. Key results have been simplified for easier reference, including community self-sufficiency and self-consumption with information about what the metrics mean. A Savings KPI has been introduced for each home in the community, showing if and how much a home has been saving compared to buying from the local utility. The total bill including amount owed or earned is shown, along with a graph of the daily savings. Asset result highlights the total amount spent or earnt by each asset, including an average price per kWh of energy. Batteries also show their current state of charge and average buying and selling price. Grid Singularity v1.4 Tutorial Version 1.0.0 \u00b6 The following features were implemented : Our new user interface (UI), found at Grid Singularity map will replace the old one at d3a.io . This new UI is intended to make creating and running simulations much easier for users who might be new to thinking about their energy use and simulating their own energy community. Additional features in the map include a search bar , which facilitates searching for an address or town on the map. After running the simulation, highlighted results displayed directly above each home and community in the map. There are standard (template) homes and profiles that can be used by users who do not have information about actual energy consumption and/or production, generated from loadprofilegenerator.de and energydatamap.com . We provide additional information on the Canary Test Network for live data simulations, which is the next step in building an energy community Animated color visuals in the map view assist analysis, with a color assigned to each home and community on the map when the simulation is running: green for net exports, blue for neutral, and red for net imports We also provide Map 3D view, where users can view their simulations and homes in 3-Dimensions Side navigation bar summarizes the contents of a users\u2019 energy community to additionally aid optimal energy community configuration Smart meter asset, a new asset type which can be configured directly in the codebase simulation file to allow users to upload smart meter net consumption and production profiles Version 0.12.0 \u00b6 The following features were implemented : Market slot length realtime: This can be set to simulations and collaborations. It slows down the running pace with a constant value (speed can go from the fasted as possible up until real-time. Public library is updated: New loads and PVs profiles were added to the public library. A total of 24 loads, representing various types of households was generated using loadprofilegenerator.de . PV production profiles were taken from energydatamap.com for different cities. These new loads and PVs have profiles of a full year (2021). Users can now download the registry page as a JSON file, to facilitate the connection with the API to a collaboration/Canary Network. Version 0.11.0 \u00b6 The following features were implemented : Time Resolution setting for graphs: Users can choose to view data in the graphs in 2 hour, 1 hour, or 15 minutes time resolution. This allows for faster loading of the graphs as the simulation run time is extended. Users can change the time resolution for the Energy Trade Profile, Energy Pricing, and Asset Profile graphs. Add a Library as an Event : Users can add grid components from the Library into their simulation while it is running. Canary Network Enhancements: Canary Networks are automatically restarted in the event of a software deploy or other system disruption. Users can view previous weeks of Canary Network data and download the results . Canary Network simulations can run for weeks at a time and store all data for future analysis and research. Users can trade through the Grid Singularity Asset and Grid Operator APIs through a cloud web service. This feature allows users to automate their trading algorithms and connect to the API from the cloud instead of hosting and monitoring on a local computer. Version 0.10.0 \u00b6 The following features were implemented : Canary Networks : An admin user can create a Canary Network simulation, which duplicates a collaboration simulation and allows the admin to connect each energy asset in the grid to its live data stream in order to simulate trading on the asset's live metered data readings. The Canary Network runs in real-time , with incoming data collected during each 15 minute market slot. Researcher users can trade on behalf of energy assets using the registry to connect to the live data stream which broadcasts the energy required for each asset through the Asset API . Grid Operator users can change the grid fees and grid parameters of each grid market using the registry which connects them to their markets through the Grid Operator API . Therefore, the Canary Network realizes the digital twin model of an energy asset and enables Researcher users to trade in real-time on behalf of their assets as a proof of concept. Once a Canary Network is established, it continues to run and agents can trade over weeks and months of time, for long term study of energy asset data and agent and market behavior. Previous weeks of data and results are saved in the results page weekly history. Island or Grid-connect a Market Maker as an event: Users can now change the role and mode of the Market Maker as an event, allowing users to simulate blackouts by changing the Market Maker to an islanding role, or simulating other impacts resulting from a change in the Market Maker parameters, such as showing the effect of connecting an islanded Market Maker to the grid. Version 0.9.0 \u00b6 The following features were implemented : Market API , which allows grid operators and researchers to monitor metrics and set grid fees in the select local energy market simulation collaboration Easier registration for researchers and grid operators to manage multiple assets and use market API through the Registry page. Bids and offers are prioritised in their first market by setting a wait time of 2 ticks before allowing them to propagate to higher markets in the grid hierarchy. This wait time is set in the backend as the minimum bid or offer age parameter. Grid fees integrated in the Results page - Energy Pricing graph for each market Total grid fees reported in the Scoreboard page that demonstrates market performance metrics for each collaboration simulation.

Requesting a Canary Network will give information about the process and requirements to set up a local energy community in your region, within regulation. A first step to setting up a Canary Network is connecting asset data sources to the simulation. Individual users can apply to participate in Canary Networks through a registry , where the exchange operator grants or denies access. Users can be invited to register through an invitation tool, and can see a list of Canary Networks to which they have been invited. Aggregators can apply through the registry to manage (i.e. run trading algorithms on behalf of) assets through the Asset API Assets can be configured to read live or uploaded data that has been sent through a live data API . The details of setting up live asset data through the API can be found here. Template scripts are available for aggregators or advanced users to trade energy through the Asset trading API. The scripts, documentation and additional information can be found here. Grid operators can also run scripts that set and change grid fees for the exchange. Both template scripts include readable text outputs from the trading or grid fee strategy Canary network results are viewable real-time, with data and trading results populated in 15 minute intervals.

These are updated while the simulation is running and stored indefinitely until the user decides to delete or to rerun the simulation. The user is able to view Results for each area or asset in the grid configuration. Navigating the grid configuration in the UI \u00b6 As shown in the image above, the user can select a market or an energy asset from a drop down to view specific results for that market or an asset while on the Results page. In the figure above, the Community market is selected. The Results page then displays relevant plots and tables for the selected market or asset. There is also the possibility to select which charts / tables you want to view / hide, as shown in the image above. This section discusses the information available in each chart / table. Energy availability \u00b6 This plot shows whether each consuming energy asset (i.e. load) inside the selected market had access to the energy it needed for each market slot. On the x-axis, the time is given. If the participating asset agent was able to purchase the energy it required for that time slot, the block will be colored green . If not, it will be colored purple . The granularity of the plot is one hour , so if there was a trade interval within the hour in which the agent was not able to buy the demanded energy, the entire block will be colored purple. The user can hover the cursor over a purple block to view a list of the energy assets that were not able to buy energy in that time slot. Self-sufficiency and self-consumption \u00b6 These two pie charts display Self-Sufficiency and Self-Consumption level of the selected area. Please see this page for more information. When the user hovers the cursor over these plots, the following quantitative energy metrics are shown: Self-consumed energy [kWh] Total demanded energy [kWh] Total produced energy [kWh] Cumulative trading \u00b6 This plot shows the total cumulative trade volumes traded among market participants (agents representing assets or markets) in the selected market in the course of the simulation. Each market participant is displayed as a uniquely colored bar that represents the energy sold (shown as negative) or bought (shown as positive). In the example below, the energy sold by House 1 is colored purple, and the House 1 bar is positive, meaning that it bought some of the energy it produced for its own use (self-consumption). The rest of the energy it sold is shown as a thin purple layer appearing in the bars of the other market participants that acted as buyers. This color coding allows the user to visually track the energy trade flows in the selected market. External Trades represent the import/export from/to a higher level market by the Inter-area agent of the selected market, and hence the difference between energy traded amongst the selected market participants and the total accumulated trades. The external trades bar represents energy produced in this market, but sold to an outside market, as well as the energy bought from an external source and sold to a participant in this market. The energy bought externally is teal in this example and the bar is negative for external trades. The energy that was sold to other market participants is indicated by a positive teal colored bar. A negative external trades bar means that the participants within the select market purchased energy externally and a positive external trades bar means that participants sold energy to an external market. Energy bills and net energy \u00b6 In the Community market shown in the figure below, the participating agents are the inter-area agents of the houses that lie within that market. The energy bill table provides information on the cumulative trade volumes of all market participants and the costs associated with trades. For each market and energy asset, the energy bought and sold during the simulation is listed, along with a total net energy consumption. The Totals column can be considered as the net energy consumption and final bill for the listed agent, which may represent an energy asset or a market (e.g. a house). The Totals row represents the total of trades that are made by all participants inside the selected market. Energy trade profile \u00b6 The energy profile shows the supply and demand of trades made inside the selected market for each market slot of the simulation. The negative side of the y-axis represents the energy sold, and the positive y-axis shows the energy bought. The different colors represent the different market participants (energy assets and markets). As all buyers and sellers of each trade are accounted for in a select market, the supply and demand sides are exact mirrors of each other in terms of volume. If peak analysis is switched on, the internal trades are hidden and only the trades including external participants are displayed. This shows how much energy required the use of transmission lines outside of the selected market. On the peak analysis plot, two lines are shown: the current peak imports and the current peak exports , representing the maximum energy imported and exported for the selected market. Another feature of this graph is viewing the Net energy , shown below. When peak analysis is activated, only net external trades of each participant are displayed. The net displays the difference between the total import and export for each market slot, useful in understanding the impact to transmission capacity . Detailed energy trade profile \u00b6 This graph is a market slot level breakdown of the energy trade profile. With this graph, the user can select a specific market slot to see when each trade was cleared during that slot, with a resolution of 30 simulated seconds. The graph's length is the market slot length (15 minutes by default). The market slot can be selected with the drop down (days) and the slider (hours and minutes). Energy pricing \u00b6 In this plot, energy pricing is shown. Depending on market design and grid configuration, there could be different price settlements in the same market slot. In this case, a minimum , maximum , and average of the trade price is shown. If no trade occurred during a certain market interval, no lines are plotted. If grid fees are set in that market as a constant value, a fourth line is plotted to reflect its price. Bids, Offers, and Trades per Market Slot \u00b6 In this plot, each bid, offer and trade posted/cleared in the selected market is shown according to its posting/clearing times, allowing the user to analyse how specific offers/bids were or were not matched and validate or further investigate their trading strategy. The x-axis of this graph is the market slot length (15 minutes by default), and the y-axis shows the bid and offer price. Each market slot of the simulation can be selected and viewed with the drop down (days) and the slider (hours & minutes). Compare results \u00b6 The user has the possibility to compare the results of two separate simulations. The user can also duplicate the simulation setup, download results or delete the configuration by using the appropriate buttons shown below: Backend Results \u00b6 After running a simulation in the backend, the user can export simulation results. This functionality is enabled by default. If you want to disable the export of simulation results, use the --no-export flag for the simulation run. Another useful parameter is: --export-path , used to change the output path of the simulation results. The default path is $HOME/d3a-simulation/ . The simulation results include analytical information about the bids, offers and trades that took place in the course of the simulation. Information about energy characteristics of each asset and market are also included (eg. battery state of charge, energy traded/requested/deficit). A detailed description of these files is available on the data download page. In addition to text files, some graphs that display aggregated market information during the course of the simulation are also exposed.

When modelling energy communities, PVs can be added to homes or, in the case of a shared resource, a community. PVs produce electricity to be self-consumed by the asset owners, sold to another member of the community, sold back to the grid, or stored in a battery for use at a later time, depending on what options are available to the owner in a select market. In the Grid Singularity Exchange user interface (Singularity Map), there are three options to model PV generation. The first option is the Custom PV tool, which allows users to quickly simulate PV generation at a specific location and orientation if an actual PV generation profile is not available. This tool uses the backend code of the Energy Data Map provided by rebase.energy , and if this service is not available, the PV generation profile is derived from the Photovoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS) .

While community operation requires real data integration, simulations may also be performed by using historical, forecast or synthetic data. Importantly, our open source and modular platform optimises the use of local resources and enables individuals with equitable access to energy trading, at par with large energy suppliers. Grid Singularity\u2019s web-based simulation tool is currently available to any user upon free registration. The user can simulate a local energy market ( energy community ) by configuring a \u201cdigital twin\u201d representation of physical grid and energy markets, with household and community assets, such as consumption assets , solar panels and batteries , and adding market information (utility price, tariffs and any other pricing information to account for grid cost and integrate external supply for trades that cannot be met locally, as well as the applicable market matching and clearing mechanism and asset trading strategies). The purpose of creating simulations is to mimic what an energy community might look like, assessing what assets (type and size) best suit the community needs and how activation in local trading affects individual and community energy cost and environmental impact. Existing community members can use it to assess any changes, such as potentially adding storage assets like a battery. The Grid Singularity simulation results can be analysed with the following key performance indicators: self-consumption, self-sufficiency, energy bill value and savings (more in development). Energy researchers can deploy more advanced simulation features both in the user interface (e.g. use custom PV tool to integrate solar profiles based on location and weather conditions) and by using the more versatile open-source, GPL v.3 backend code of the Grid Singularity Exchange. Furthermore, live testing of different local energy markets can be enabled by connecting a digital energy community (live data streams from real energy assets) to the Grid Singularity Test Network . The Grid Singularity Medium Channel features several studies that assess the financial and social benefits of local trading, and the impact of different energy assets and system actions like applying different grid tariff models . This wiki provides a detailed guide for prosumers and energy communities to set up a simulation , as well as additional guidelines for asset managers and grid operators . Accompanying video tutorials can be found here . Figure . Grid Aware Markets: Trading agents place bids and offers on behalf of assets via the Asset API. Agents trade based on user preferences such as energy source and preferred trading partner. Grid Operators implement dynamic grid tariffs in energy markets through the Grid Operator API. Grid Singularity facilitates an individual or energy asset-centred, bottom-up market design by connecting aggregators and grid operators, through an application interface ( Asset API and Grid Operator API , respectively). More specifically, aggregators connect distributed energy assets of a community (including households, businesses and other energy users), while grid operators account for grid costs and access local flexibility for advanced grid management. Connected energy assets are digitally represented by trading agents pursuing trading strategies currently based on price but with a capability to be based on more advanced user preferences, such as consuming only renewable energy or trading with a preferred partner, achieving diverse degrees of freedom . Assets are typically grouped inside homes based on the owner and trade in a community market. Multiple communities can be connected inside higher markets depending on the geographical reach of the peer-to-peer system and voltage architecture of the grid. Figure . Grid Singularity Exchange: data flows from energy assets over aggregators and trading agents via APIs for matching. Energy Web's open source toolkit can be integrated for decentralised asset registry and data access management functionality. Grid Singularity\u2019s technical approach includes a decentralised, Substrate-based blockchain implementation to advance scalability and security of the exchange (GSy DEX). The Energy Web Chain is the blockchain of choice for GSy DEX, anchored upon Polkadot\u2019s scaling solution. Grid Singularity, an energy technology startup, and the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit clean technology organisation, jointly founded the Energy Web Foundation (EWF) in January 2017 as a non-profit entrepreneurial foundation building web3 applications for the energy transition. Having significantly contributed to EWF development and the launch of the Energy Web Chain, Grid Singularity\u2019s role today in the Energy Web is supervisory and advisory via Foundation Council. Notably, we do not rely on a proof-of-work mechanism of validation and therefore do not overuse electricity . Our path to decentralisation and the implementation of Symbiotic Energy Markets is described in the following discussion paper . When the Grid Singularity Exchange is deployed as a distributed local energy exchange, the traditional role of the grid operator, which manages the connection to the power grid, and the utility, as a provider of energy, would still continue to be required to integrate the local energy market with the wider grid network. This ensures the reliability of supply in case of a deficit within a community but also export possibilities in case of a surplus. The primary difference is that a utility would no longer be the only market actor with which a household exchanges energy, but one of multiple. To use the Grid Singularity software to operate an energy community, customisation is required to apply local regulation and a partnership with a local company to enable data connectivity and manage billing and other non-trading operations. In the European Union (EU), this includes ensuring support from a distribution systems operator (DSO) to validate the number of participants and the volume of energy exchanged on the affected distribution grid. Notably, most regions today, including EU member states, allow only community trading with a preset, single community-level price rather than actual peer-to-peer trading. For this reason any operational implementation would be limited to the applicable local trading mechanism, reducing the options and thus also the benefits facilitated by the Grid Singularity software tools. Grid Singularity fosters interoperability and open-source development, collaborating with other market actors that provide grid management and asset aggregation services and supporting complementary services such as data and smart trading algorithm that further enhance the efficiency of local energy markets (LEM), optimising the use of local renewable resources and other individual and community benefits. Grid Singularity\u2019s Exchange is a highly innovative and effective grid modernisation solution. First, it empowers customer engagement and provides utmost degrees of freedom in energy markets enhancing individual and community choices (e.g., type of energy consumed or preferred trading partner), lowering barriers and creating incentives for all participants. Second, it creates a resilient market by ensuring equal access, transparent pricing, and trading at optimal market levels (i.e., between assets and buildings or facility and grid). Third, it incentivizes and facilitates the integration of clean distributed energy resources (DERs) onto the grid closer to load centers. Fourth, grid operators can use it to implement flexible grid tariffs to benefit from the local market flexibility to alleviate congestion. Fifth, the Grid Singularity API provides instantaneous granular data to the grid operator\u2013which historically has relied upon changes in detected load and alterations from the forecast\u2013enabling the operator to improve management, flexibility, and grid performance. Sixth, peer-to-peer trading is market-driven , not based upon predetermined pricing, which optimizes local consumption and thus the use of (cheaper) local renewables, increasing affordability, reducing reliance and overall/peak load on the grid, supporting efficient asset utilization, and reducing system losses. Seventh, it increases community self-sufficiency and energy savings , providing emergency power backup, and mitigating the need for new transmission infrastructure. Finally, the peer-to-peer trading system incentivizes private investment in electric system infrastructure by increasing revenue from renewable DERs and providing decision-making tools.", "title": "Grid Singularity Technical Approach"}, {"location": "trade-profile/", "text": "The trade profile shows the energy traded in kilowatt hours (kWh) in the respective market (home market or community market) per 15-minute market slot over a defined time frame (weekly or monthly).

This allows for a comparison of the costs and benefits of the two alternatives, including an assessment on the impact on the grid stability by potentially adding heat pumps to the system. Finally, it facilitates the sizing optimization (selection of the model, the rating or other nameplate parameters) of the heat pump if there is a consideration to replace the district heating connection. The modelled trading strategy assumes that the district heating network connection would be replaced by a ground source heat pump, which includes a water tank storage (reference model illustrated in the figure below). The heat pump is modelled in its entirety as a single system and not as separate units; therefore, the condenser and the compressor are both accounted for in the electricity demand. Other VHP configuration parameters can be modified to suit a particular use case, as described in the Virtual Heat Pump Code Configuration section. Figure 2.29 : Ground source virtual heat pump diagram The heat pump operation steps are the following: Heat from the water pipes (boreholes) in the ground (#1 in Figure 2.29) is transferred to the source side of the heat pump, via the heat exchanger (evaporator) (#2 in Figure 2.29) The heat pump compressor (#3 in Figure 2.29) increases the pressure and the temperature of the gas medium. The heat from the condenser side of the heat pump is transferred to the water tank storage via the second heat exchanger (#4 in Figure 2.29) and the gas medium is cooled and converted to liquid (condensed). The water tank storage (#5 in Figure 2.29) temperature is increased as a result of the heat produced by the heat pump condenser in step #3. Heat from the water tank storage is used in order to provide the heat demand of the building (#6 in Figure 2.29). Unlike the heat pump model described above, district heating networks use water pipes that are directly connected to the building, and usually the supply temperature, return temperature and water flow rates are measured in order to facilitate customer billing. The virtual heat pump model can use these district heating measurements to calculate the heat demand of the building. The heat demand is then provided as an input for the VHP model to calculate the energy that needs to be consumed by the heat pump in order to provide the heat demand, taking into account the flexibility that the water tank storage provides. A configuration of multiple water tanks is also supported, allowing the monitoring and analysis of the temperature of each individual water tank that is connected to the heat pump. Since multiple water tanks are generally installed to satisfy different sources of heat demand (e.g. space heating and domestic hot water), modelling multiple water tanks provides further insights regarding the heat pump\u2019s operational effectiveness to meet these different types of heat demand. In such a configuration, the heat exchangers between the condenser side of the heat pump and each water tank (#4 in Figure 2.29) are assumed to be identical and the heat generated by the heat pump is attributed proportionally to all water tanks, consequently increasing the temperature of each water tank based on its portion of the generated heat. Conversely, the heat demand is also proportionally split to all water tanks, decreasing the temperature of each water tank commensurately. Virtual Heat Pump Model Equations \u00b6 The model of the virtual heat pump comprises a set of mathematical equations that each simulates a different component of a heat pump system. The system of linear equations is optimised, in order to define the state and operation of the simulated heat pump. The optimisation parameter of the proposed model is the target temperature of the storage. The system is allowed to monitor the current temperature of the storage, and aims to achieve a target storage temperature that is bounded by the limitations of the minimum and the maximum temperatures of the water tank. The output of the proposed model is the calculation of the electricity consumption of the heat pump \\(P_{el-hp}\\) , which can be used for this asset to participate in the energy market, while incorporating the flexibility provided by the water tank storage. The electricity consumption, which is related to a supplied heat \\(Q_{hp_{out}}\\) and COP, is calculated based on the following equation: \\[Q_{hp_{out}} = P_{el-hp} * COP \\tag{1}\\] The electricity consumption of the heat pump is upper-bounded by the maximum power consumption of the heat pump: \\[P_{el-hp} <= P_{el-hp-max} \\tag{2}\\] The assumption is that the losses from the heat exchanger between the heat pump and the storage are ignored, and that the heat supplied by the heat pump to the storage is roughly equivalent to the heat generated by the heat pump itself: \\(Q_{in} \\small \\cong Q_{hp_{out}}\\) resulting in \\[Q_{hp_{out}} = P_{el-hp} \\cdot COP = Q_{in} \\tag{3}\\] The \\(COP\\) at each time slot will be calculated as \\[ COP= \\eta T_{condenser} / (T_{condenser} - T_{source}) \\tag{4}\\] Where: \\(\\eta\\) is the empirical calibration coefficient for water-to-water heat pumps \\(T_{source}\\) is the district heating supply temperature \\(T_{condenser}\\) is the condenser (or sink) temperature The formula is based on the Carnot equation, with the default calibration coefficient of \u03b7=0.6 selected based upon a literature review of different COP formulations. This coefficient can be changed in the backend code. A required input for solving the preceding equations is the amount of heat generated by the heat pump ( \\(Q_{hp_{out}}\\) ), and it needs to be associated with the water tank model (since the heat generated by the heat pump is used exclusively to increase the water tank temperature and provide the heat demand of the home as the main input of our model). The underlying premise is that the heat input to the water tank should be equal to the heat that is extracted from the water tank to cover the heat demand of the building, plus the extra heat stored in the water tank.

This allows for a comparison of the costs and benefits of the two alternatives, including an assessment on the impact on the grid stability by potentially adding heat pumps to the system. Finally, it facilitates the sizing optimization (selection of the model, the rating or other nameplate parameters) of the heat pump if there is a consideration to replace the district heating connection. The modelled trading strategy assumes that the district heating network connection would be replaced by a ground source heat pump, which includes a water tank storage (reference model illustrated in the figure below). The heat pump is modelled in its entirety as a single system and not as separate units; therefore, the condenser and the compressor are both accounted for in the electricity demand. Other VHP configuration parameters can be modified to suit a particular use case, as described in the Virtual Heat Pump Code Configuration section. Figure 2.29 : Ground source virtual heat pump diagram The heat pump operation steps are the following: Heat from the water pipes (boreholes) in the ground (#1 in Figure 2.29) is transferred to the source side of the heat pump, via the heat exchanger (evaporator) (#2 in Figure 2.29) The heat pump compressor (#3 in Figure 2.29) increases the pressure and the temperature of the gas medium. The heat from the condenser side of the heat pump is transferred to the water tank storage via the second heat exchanger (#4 in Figure 2.29) and the gas medium is cooled and converted to liquid (condensed). The water tank storage (#5 in Figure 2.29) temperature is increased as a result of the heat produced by the heat pump condenser in step #3. Heat from the water tank storage is used in order to provide the heat demand of the building (#6 in Figure 2.29). Unlike the heat pump model described above, district heating networks use water pipes that are directly connected to the building, and usually the supply temperature, return temperature and water flow rates are measured in order to facilitate customer billing. The virtual heat pump model can use these district heating measurements to calculate the heat demand of the building. The heat demand is then provided as an input for the VHP model to calculate the energy that needs to be consumed by the heat pump in order to provide the heat demand, taking into account the flexibility that the water tank storage provides. A configuration of multiple water tanks is also supported, allowing the monitoring and analysis of the temperature of each individual water tank that is connected to the heat pump. Since multiple water tanks are generally installed to satisfy different sources of heat demand (e.g. space heating and domestic hot water), modelling multiple water tanks provides further insights regarding the heat pump\u2019s operational effectiveness to meet these different types of heat demand. In such a configuration, the heat exchangers between the condenser side of the heat pump and each water tank (#4 in Figure 2.29) are assumed to be identical and the heat generated by the heat pump is attributed proportionally to all water tanks, consequently increasing the temperature of each water tank based on its portion of the generated heat. Conversely, the heat demand is also proportionally split to all water tanks, decreasing the temperature of each water tank commensurately.", "title": "Virtual Heat Pump Model"}, {"location": "virtual-heat-pump/#virtual-heat-pump-model-equations", "text": "The model of the virtual heat pump comprises a set of mathematical equations that each simulates a different component of a heat pump system. The system of linear equations is optimised, in order to define the state and operation of the simulated heat pump. The optimisation parameter of the proposed model is the target temperature of the storage. The system is allowed to monitor the current temperature of the storage, and aims to achieve a target storage temperature that is bounded by the limitations of the minimum and the maximum temperatures of the water tank. The output of the proposed model is the calculation of the electricity consumption of the heat pump \\(P_{el-hp}\\) , which can be used for this asset to participate in the energy market, while incorporating the flexibility provided by the water tank storage. The electricity consumption, which is related to a supplied heat \\(Q_{hp_{out}}\\) and COP, is calculated based on the following equation: \\[Q_{hp_{out}} = P_{el-hp} * COP \\tag{1}\\] The electricity consumption of the heat pump is upper-bounded by the maximum power consumption of the heat pump: \\[P_{el-hp} <= P_{el-hp-max} \\tag{2}\\] The assumption is that the losses from the heat exchanger between the heat pump and the storage are ignored, and that the heat supplied by the heat pump to the storage is roughly equivalent to the heat generated by the heat pump itself: \\(Q_{in} \\small \\cong Q_{hp_{out}}\\) resulting in \\[Q_{hp_{out}} = P_{el-hp} \\cdot COP = Q_{in} \\tag{3}\\] The \\(COP\\) at each time slot will be calculated as \\[ COP= \\eta T_{condenser} / (T_{condenser} - T_{source}) \\tag{4}\\] Where: \\(\\eta\\) is the empirical calibration coefficient for water-to-water heat pumps \\(T_{source}\\) is the district heating supply temperature \\(T_{condenser}\\) is the condenser (or sink) temperature The formula is based on the Carnot equation, with the default calibration coefficient of \u03b7=0.6 selected based upon a literature review of different COP formulations. This coefficient can be changed in the backend code. A required input for solving the preceding equations is the amount of heat generated by the heat pump ( \\(Q_{hp_{out}}\\) ), and it needs to be associated with the water tank model (since the heat generated by the heat pump is used exclusively to increase the water tank temperature and provide the heat demand of the home as the main input of our model).
